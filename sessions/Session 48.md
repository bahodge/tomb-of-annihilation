## Level 4

[[Munch]] starts looking at the ruby she picked up and learns that it is the [[Eye of Zaltec]]. For now, she keeps this information to herself.

We find a room with some artists and some paintings. there is a gross throne made out of skin and bones. [[Khara]] speaks to her god and learns that old omuns used to make furniture out of dead omuns.

[[Khara]] sits in the throne and immediately goes berserk and attacks everyone in the room. We kill all the zombies that appear and find a hidden room.

We find and open a sarcophagus containing the remains of a dead body.
