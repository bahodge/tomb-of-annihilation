[[Munch]] starts looking at the ruby she picked up and learns that it is the [[Eye of Zaltec]]. For now, she keeps this information to herself.

We find a room with some artists and some paintings. there is a gross throne made out of skin and bones. [[Khara]] speaks to her god and learns that old omuns used to make furniture out of dead omuns.

[[Khara]] sits in the throne and immediately goes berserk and attacks everyone in the room. We kill all the zombies that appear and find a hidden room.

We find and open a sarcophagus containing the remains of a dead body.

We loot:
- 1 hornet mask ([[Munch]] wears it) worth 250gp
- 1 jewelry box with a neckless of fireballs
- 2 adamantine maces

[[Merrick]] puts on the necklass and it explodes! We all almost die.

We go to another room and find another sarcophagus.

We loot:
- 10 opaleceant bracelets 75gp each
	- made of flail snails
- 1 very scintillating looking robe

[[Khara]] feels a blessing overtake her.

We find the [[Navel of the Moon]] and [[Munch]]
