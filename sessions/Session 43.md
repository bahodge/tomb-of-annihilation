## Level 3

[[Indy]] drinks a healing potion and heals up from 4 hp. We continue to the north on the third level. We reach a T intersection and start looking around. We see a Minotaur etched into a barrier.[[Munch]] lifts up the barrier. We continue down the tunnel and the gate shuts behind us. We begin exploring the tunnels. We see a skeleton dart off and begin pursuing it.

We get to this large room with a massive pit and cornered by 2 balconies. There is a scary winged fiend statue. We back track a bit an explore the tunnels a little more. We were trapped in the room and are almost killed by a spinning room. [[Khara]] busts through the door and we make our way out of the spinning room of death.

We kill the skeleton we saw earlier. We are in a room with a pit and there is a force field preventing the skeleton bones from falling into the pit. We pick up the skeleton bones and it's headgear is a pentagon. We find another door down a corridor. There is a large round mirror set into it's surface. There are 10 indentations about an inch across around the mirror. We notice a very obvious secret door in the room with gollum.

We jump jump across the platforms towards the statue of the fiend and find a place to take a long rest.

We continue through the water and use tridents to pass a water wall. 

We find a corpse of a dragonborne. Has green skin and a has a distinctive scar/birthmark that looks like [[Jr]].

	- this is the weapon that the guards would carry ukla
- long stick with dinosaur claws on it, a giant back scratcher

We make our way out of a deadly puzzle and find the entrance of the room where we saw the dwarf get eaten by the locus. We find 

- yellow turban
- fancy gems found worth 500gp
- diamond worth 500gp
- 2 1 inch diameter eyeballs
	- 1 dark blue
	- 1 purple

[[Indy]] and [[Khara]] solve a pressure plate puzzle. The sarcophagus opens and he finds a [[almiraj]] horn. [[Indy]] consents to being entered by the [[almiraj]] spirit. 

We find a shadowy spirit and force it to drink some green liquid and find an orange eyeball gem. We find a bright green eyeball gem behind a hawk statue. We find another pale purple eyeball gems.

We move back to the room with the gollum and start messing with the statues. [[Khara]] gets teleported inside of the location where the gollum is and the gollum is teleported onto the same level as [[Munch]] and [[Indy]]. [[Khara]] opens the chest and all of her metal objects are disintegrated. [[Khara]] finds 2 more eyeball gems. 1 pink gem & 1 pale green gem

---
We insert all of the gems using mage hand and [[Munch]]'s ants all grow beards. The door grinds open and we a large treasure room with floating a thing.
