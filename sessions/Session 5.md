Session 4 recap


We go to the market and start to buy supplies for the trip to Fort Belurarian. We buy equipment and distribute it throughout the party. We go to the thundering lizard and speak with Rohkhan and let him know that we are headed out. We travel through the jungle and come to the fort atop a hill. The entire structure is made of wood and overlooks the surrounding area. We approach the gates and meet Gruta, the Castilion of the fort. All are welcome in Fort Beluarian. We are told to speak to the captain about slaying undead. We walk to the stables and speak to Taven the Bald as he feeds hay to the horses. There are 4 draught horses in the stables. 

We speak to the forge master and helm priest and learn about the fort. The only threats are the undead. We hire a guide to help us find and kill undead for the Captain. Pandora bites through the bell rope, and causes a big distraction. Rohkhan steals a journal from the captain. He found information that Captain Porter is working with the big 3 pirates where they wonâ€™t attack any Baldurian ships in exchange for information.

We travel into the jungle and fight some ghouls. Will kill them and collect 6 ghoul heads.
