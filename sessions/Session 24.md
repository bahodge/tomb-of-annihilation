Munch has 2 [[wounds]]. [[Inflammation]] and [[minor organ necrosis]]. 

[[Pandora]] saves the party with a massive moonbeam on the boss! [[Captain Zaroum Al-Saryak]] melts into flames.

On his body we find:
- a stone eye
- a shimmering cloak
- a scimitar


we find out that the stone eye is a sending stone that is paired with the one from [[Captain Porter]]. We continue to scout throughout the ship and come across a ghost and several other crew members. We begin killing all of them. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] sustains a horrendous [[groin injury]].

We loot all of the corpses. [[Munch]] takes and wears a tri-corn pirate hat. 

- We find 1 gem worth 10gp
- We also find a pouch with 6gp
- We find a hand hook 
- abottle of rum 3/4 full

We speak to some isolated crewmates in the brig that are grey. They say that they have [[The Grey]]. We go to [[Bosco's Bilge]] and tell them that we cleared the [[Emerald Eye]] and loot the vault.

We find:
- 6400cp
- 2500sp
- 300gp
- 60pp
- 10 golden braclets
- Electrum goblet
- 2 wooden scrolls in tubes.

We split out our share:
- 4267cp
- 1667sp
- 200gp
- 40pp
- 6 gold braclets
- 1 electrum goblet
- 2 unnamed scrolls

We speak with [[Bosco]] and he says that he would be interested in becoming a privateer. We agree that [[Bosco]] will help us take the [[Dragon Fang]] ship and then return to [[Port Nyanzahru]] to discuss a contract with the [[Trade Princes]].
