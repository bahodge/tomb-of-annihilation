As thanks for protecting and rescuing [[Munch]] from prison, [[Munch]] has sworn a life debt to [[Pandora]]. [[Cyan]] records the event and gives [[Pandora]] the record. [[Munch]] wakes up missing a clump of hair. [[Nanny Pu'Pu]], is the prime suspect and from this point forward, [[Munch]] will actively avoid her. We ask [[Cyan]] if he knows anything about missing parts.

[[Munch]] and [[Pandora]] find a note written in blood stabbed into their door. "The debt must be paid" was written on the note.

We think that the [[Trade Prince Jesamine]] may have sanctioned the assassination attempt. We should speak with her to see who put out a us.

We buy a bunch of supplies for pirate hunting. We hear that there is a pirate port out towards the west. We finish buying supplies and set sail. We head west from [[Port Nyanzahru]].

We spend the night on a beach and are attacked by 2 T Rexes. We kill them and harvest

- teeth & claws
- bones
- 30 days of food
- dinosaur bones for creating 2 armor sets
- defanged t-rex skull for mounting on the ship
- [[Cyan]] t-rex urine sack

As we are eating, we see a pirate ship approach. We get back to the [[Taban's Big Deck]] and try to sail away from the ship. We cleverly run [[Sturge]] aground. We convince the captain's crew to meet us on the beach. [[Pandora]] disables the rudder and poisons the food with Assassin's Blood poison.

[[Munch]] is covered in t-rex blood.

We meet the crew of [[Sturge]] on the beach and [[Jr]] attacks with an awesome fire breath! We fought tooth and nail and killed a few pirates but [[Jr]] was struck down by the First Mate of [[Sturge]].
