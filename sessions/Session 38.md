We consent to being shackled. We lay down our weapons and [[Munch]] quickly swallows the seed. We are shackled. We are taken to a room with a large room with a relief of a giant serpent and worshipers doing horrible things.

 The air in the room reeks of dung. We are taken to a prison and locked up. Each of us are split up into pit cells. 

## Cell 1 
 
 [[Cyan]] sees [[Queen Grabstab]]. [[Queen Grabstab]] had also planted her seed and was about to perform the ritual but was captured. [[Cyan]] also meets [[Dragonbait]], companion to [[Artis Cymber]]. They are here to kill [[Raj'nisi]] but were captured before they could. [[Cyan]] also learns that the carving with the snake is actually a teleporter used by [[Raj'nisi]].

## Cell 2

[[Munch]] and [[Indy]] are put into a cell with [[Pottery Shard]] and [[Olooma Authdamar]]. We ask how we can get out and [[Olooma Authdamar]] gives us a dagger. [[Munch]] hides the dagger in her hair.

## Cell 3

[[Khar]] and [[Merrick Ravenshade]] are put in a cell with [[Lomar Dral]] and [[Zilla Atazi]]. [[Lomar Dral]]. The kind of slavery they do every day is not explained.

## Cell 4

[[Selida]] is thrown into this cell.

---
We hear some steps in a we [[Yahru]]. He asks what our motivations are and [[Merrick Ravenshade]] lies very poorly. He says that if we do well, they won't kill us if we behave. We are told the [[Overseer Ahara]] will come. 

We are told that we should watch what we say because he will report us to and kill us.

We fall asleep and awake the next day.
