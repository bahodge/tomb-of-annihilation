We consent to being shackled. We lay down our weapons and [[Munch]] quickly swallows the seed. We are shackled. We are taken to a room with a large room with a relief of a giant serpent and worshipers doing horrible things.

 The air in the room reeks of dung. We are taken to a prison and locked up. Each of us are split up into pit cells. 

## Cell 1 
 
 [[Cyan]] sees [[Queen Grabstab]]. [[Queen Grabstab]] had also planted her seed and was about to perform the ritual but was captured. [[Cyan]] also meets [[Dragonbait]], companion to [[Artis Cymber]]. They are here to kill [[Ras Nisi]] but were captured before they could. [[Cyan]] also learns that the carving with the snake is actually a teleporter used by [[Ras Nisi]].

## Cell 2

[[Munch]] and [[Indy]] are put into a cell with [[Pottery Shard]] and [[Olooma Authdamar]]. We ask how we can get out and [[Olooma Authdamar]] gives us a dagger. [[Munch]] hides the dagger in her hair.

## Cell 3

[[Khar]] and [[Merrick]] are put in a cell with [[Lomar Dral]] and [[Zilla Atazi]]. [[Lomar Dral]]. The kind of slavery they do every day is not explained.

## Cell 4

[[Salida]] is thrown into this cell.

---
We hear some steps in a we [[Yahru]]. He asks what our motivations are and [[Merrick]] lies very poorly. He says that if we do well, they won't kill us if we behave. We are told the [[Overseer Aohara]] will come. 

We are told that we should watch what we say because he will report us to and kill us.

---

We fall asleep and awake the next day. We hear a slither enter the room. We are pulled out of the pit cells. A snake person and a small boy are in the room. [[Overseer Ahara]] has assigned us tasks. 

- [[Munch]] is assigned to muck out the dino pen.
- [[Cyan]] is assigned to clean the poison pen
- [[Indy]] is cleaning the bloodroom
- [[Merrick]] is rearanging the contents of the storeroom
- [[Khar]] is to clean the nests

We are shuffled up to our task areas.

[[Munch]] and [[Queen Grabstab]] are reunited. A guard complains about a corrupt guard at the front gate, [[Nanth]]. One of the guards is also very distracted eating candied [[Grung]] eggs. 

[[Khar]] overhears the words "black feather, white mask" as he is performing his tasks. 

[[Merrick]] goes to organize the store room and sees giant constrictor snake. It is named [[Azi Mas]]. She was asked about anything about the slaves. [[Fin'thaza]] is probably planning a coup. We should be sure to not hurt [[Azi Mas]].

[[Cyan]] heads to the poison distillery. He advertises his skills and is told to put them back. He learns more about the poisons about. We 

[[Indy]] heads tot he showers and overhears a [[Yuan-ti]] talking about a black opal crown. She says that she thinks that is how they can summon [[Dendar]] and that they are losing faith in [[Ras Nisi]].

We all head back to our cells.

---
 The next day, no work today. We have meetings with [[Yahru]]. He will meet with us in the columned hallway. We are asked about our opinion on [[Fin'thaza]]. We have none. We learn that top slaves go through rituals and that they might survive to become a [[Yuan-ti]]. We are told to meet [[Fin'thaza]] at `x` time. 

We learn that [[Nanth]] will let us out of the front gate if we kill [[Sekelok]]. We walk up and knock on the door to meet [[Fin'thaza]].

We talk to her about overthrowing [[Ras Nisi]] and agree that she will help us get our equipment.

We are taken to the thrown room and meet [[Ras Nisi]]. [[Ras Nisi]] informs us that [[Fin'thaza]] is a traitor and [[Ras Nisi]] kills [[Yahru]]. Turns out that [[Salida]] is a traitor. We need to kill her. "She is literally the worst person in the entirety of the universe for deceiving us" - [[Cyan]].

We convince [[Ras Nisi]] that we need to get to the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. He says that it is in the north of the city. We are given our equipment and leave the city.

Keys are located at
- hex 9 - [[Kubazan]] shrine

We learn we have 2 keys right now. We take a long rest. We rendezvous with [[Vorn]] and head towards [[Queen Nang Nang]]'s shrine. 

## Sector 41

We arrive at a shrine to [[Queen Nang Nang]] and see many dead [[Grung]]. [[Merrick|Merrick]] says that the area is gross. There is are two monoliths. We don't see anything that might have killed all the [[Grung]]. 

We see a quote saying, "Nangnang teaches us to serve only ourselves". We also read of a story in which [[Queen Nang Nang]] steals a spear from [[Shegambi]]. We end up trying to figure out who is the wealthiest. So [[Cyan]], [[Munch]] and [[Merrick]] start stealing stuff and the door opens for [[Merrick]]. She grabes one of the cubes with an Icon of [[Queen Nang Nang]]. We now have 3 cubes.

## Sector 34

We head to [[Obelack]]'s shrine
