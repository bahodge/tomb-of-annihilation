We consent to being shackled. We lay down our weapons and [[Munch]] quickly swallows the seed. We are shackled. We are taken to a room with a large room with a relief of a giant serpent and worshipers doing horrible things.

 The air in the room reeks of dung. We are taken to a prison and locked up. Each of us are split up into pit cells. [[Cyan]] sees [[Queen Grabstab]].
