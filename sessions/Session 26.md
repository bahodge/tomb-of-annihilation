We begin to question [[Captain Elock J'harwan]]. We convince her to help us sail back to [[Port Nyanzahru]]. We all put our eye patches and follow her to the booty hole. Empty the booty hole and split all the booty with the people who help us.  

We gather a bunch of loot from the booty hole, and give an item to [[Cyan]]. 

- [[Illusionist Bracers]]
- 60gp
- 140sp
- 1 potion of water breathing
- 5 bolts of silk
- fine thread of various colors
- a disassembled loom
- lots of sewing needles

we distribute the 60gp 

We speak to the pirate in the tavern and discuss the plan to confront [[Arameg]]. We decide to just pay the turtle. We party with the pirates.

The next day we start sailing back to [[Port Nyanzahru]]. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] decides to join the [[Dinoseurs]]. We begin making our way back. We learn some more about ourselves and how bad we are at crafting shit. 

We arrive near [[Port Nyanzahru]] and are greeted by [[Arameg]]. She asks for gold, gems and goods. We give [[Arameg]] all of our copper and a bolt of silk. All the ships in the fleet make it back to the [[Port Nyanzahru]]. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] casts major image and helps convince the authorities that we aren't pirates.

[[Harbor Master Zendar]] sees [[Captain Elock J'harwan]] and tries to stab her. [[Indy]] makes a proposition to save her life as she should be a privateer. We are given

- 7500gp

The [[Harbor Master Zendar]] informs us that there is a plague going around town, [[The Grey]]. We also decide to go speak with [[Trade Prince Zhan'ti]]. We go to the [[Temple of Sune]] to get healed. [[Annette]] heals [[Munch]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]]. [[Grandfather Zatembe]] was stricken mad by [[The Grey]]. 

We got talk with [[Grandfather Zatembe]]. He is at his desk, shaking and pale. He says that [[Syndra Silvayn]] came by and wasn't feeling well.  She was rather "grey" and he tried to do a reading. It was an ominous presence and he is hesitant to speak about details.

[[Grandfather Zatembe]] tried to divine the source of [[The Grey]].  "i saw so many souls being ripped into the jungle and a city deep in the south enclosed by cliffs and infested with snakes. The souls were being tortured and being consumed?" He sensed that the city was far to the South, deep to the jungle. Shortly after the reading, [[Syndra Silvayn]] died.

We leave to the bath house and take a bath. [[Munch]] steals a handful of gold from the donation box with the help of [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]]. We are speaking about [[Artis Cymber]] and we meet [[Zendalla]], his daughter. She has a pseudo dragon around her neck. [[Indy]] doesn't remember [[Artis Cymber]] ever mentioned having a daughter. Last she heard, [[Artis Cymber]] was leaving the city with a reptilian man. We think that she is not a good person and she is staying at the [[Keyas House of Repose]].

We leave the bath house and go talk to [[Trade Prince Zhan'ti]]. We propose that [[Captain Zaroum Al-Saryak]], [[Bosco]] and [[Jumal]] become hired privateers for the [[Trade Princes]]. We are officially pardoned for all of our crimes. Now she wants us to help her kill [[Arameg]]. If we are are able to kill [[Arameg]], we will be given one of the Pirate ships. We think that the three sailing ships could probably take on [[Arameg]]. We ask for some gems for [[Vorn]] and she tells us that we can charge the gems with a moonbeam. We can also speak with [[Oculeth]] to see if he can fix [[Vorn]]'s self healing function. [[Oculeth]] can also offer some teleportation services.

We go to [[Oculeth]]'s shop. We ask about teleportation. We would need some special reagents but would be interested in starting a teleportation network.

We go on a shopping spree and upgrade the party. We go speak with the crew fixing up the air ship and they say there is only a few pieces needed. We learn that the adamantine mines are in the south in [[Hrakamar]].

We want to go talk to the dwarf guide [[Musharib]] to hire him to guide us into the jungle. We arrive at the [[Thundering Lizard]] and see [[Hugh Hackenstone]] and [[Musharib]] enjoying [[Tej wine]] together.

We hire both [[Musharib]] and [[Hugh Hackenstone]] to kill the dragon and liberate [[Hrakamar]].

Next Time:
- Get [[Vorn]] and drop him off at [[Oculeth]] to get him fixed.
- Go to [[Hrakamar]]
- Kill the fire newts
- Go to [[Wyrmheart Mine]]
- Kill the [[Dragon Tinder]]
