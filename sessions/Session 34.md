## Garden Palace of Nangalor

[[Pandora]] and [[Cyan]] look to harvest from some of the plants. We continue towards the second section of the [[Garden Palace of Nangalor]].  [[Indy]] stomps into the second half. We enter the building at the end of the palace and see more exquisite statues.

A figure appears dressed in beautiful feathery clothes. She says "Strangers have come to Nangalor my love, what boon do they seek?". She is [[Queen Zelkor]], Queen of [[Lost City of Omu|Omu]]. [[Cyan]] enters the room and complements his craftsmanship.
