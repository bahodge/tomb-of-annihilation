## Garden Palace of Nangalor

[[Pandora]] and [[Cyan]] look to harvest from some of the plants. We continue towards the second section of the [[Garden Palace of Nangalor]].  [[Indy]] stomps into the second half. We enter the building at the end of the palace and see more exquisite statues.

A figure appears dressed in beautiful feathery clothes. She says "Strangers have come to Nangalor my love, what boon do they seek?". She is [[Queen Zelkor]], Queen of [[Lost City of Omu|Omu]]. [[Cyan]] enters the room and complements his craftsmanship. We ask for a trade for a [[Black Orchid]]. She says we can get it by bringing her the [[Eye of Zaltec]] to bring back her lover. She also wants the [[Skull Chalice of Ch'ghkare]]. 

[[Pandora]] becomes [[Pandora]] the panderer and compliments the heckos peckos out of [[Queen Zelkor]] to avoid being turned into stone. She also has a great-great granddaughter in [[Kir Sabal]]. She tells us that we can find the [[Lost City of Omu]] in between the [[Peeks of Flame]] and the [[Valley of Lost Honor]]. It will be hard to find because it sank.

As everyone is distracted [[Munch]] scurries down and steals the [[Black Orchid]] from the [[Queen Zelkor]]'s chamber and starts combat for everyone. "[[Munch]] drives stories forward" - [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn|Lorenzo]].

Steven says some bullshit about a burning bird flying through a water fountain to douse it's flame. [[Pandora]] rebukes the fuck out of a giant bird.

[[Munch]] gets [[minor kidney failure]]. We loot some vials.

[[Pandora]] is struck down by arrows and dies. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn|Lorenzo]] was also murdered by [[Queen Zelkor]].
