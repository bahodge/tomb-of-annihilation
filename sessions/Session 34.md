## Garden Palace of Nangalor

[[Pandora]] and [[Cyan]] look to harvest from some of the plants. We continue towards the second section of the [[Garden Palace of Nangalor]].  [[Indy]] stomps into the second half. We enter the building at the end of the palace and see more exquisite statues.

A figure appears dressed in beautiful feathery clothes. She says "Strangers have come to Nangalor my love, what boon do they seek?". She is [[Queen Zelkor]], Queen of [[Lost City of Omu|Omu]]. [[Cyan]] enters the room and complements his craftsmanship. We ask for a trade for a [[Black Orchid]]. She says we can get it by bringing her the [[Eye of Zaltec]] to bring back her lover. She also wants the [[Skull Chalice of Ch'ghkare]]. 

[[Pandora]] becomes [[Pandora]] the panderer and compliments the heckos peckos out of [[Queen Zelkor]] to avoid being turned into stone. She also has a great-great granddaughter in [[Kir Sabal]].
