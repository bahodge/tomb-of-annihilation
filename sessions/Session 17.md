We killed all the [[pterafolk]] and began searching the cave. We pick the cave clean. We grab a bunch of bones from the piles, and plan on taking them to [[Nanny Pu'Pu]]. We harvest some wing flaps from the [[pterafolk]]. We gander towards the south but we see what looks like a shipwreck very far to the south. We also see a strange floating rock in the sky about the size of a house.

We formally introduce ourselves to [[Nanny Pu'Pu]] and get some real “evil granny vibes” from her. We allow [[Nanny Pu'Pu]] into the party. 

We all level up to 6. We continue down towards [[Aldani Basin]]. We get lost in the basin and find some undead tracks. We head towards the tracks of the shambling undead towards the floating boulder. We estimate that there are less than 50 undead. We take a point of exhaustion as we travel towards the boulder. We arrive at the boulder.

A massive chunk of earth has been ripped from the earth with a massive petrified atop the boulder. There is red liquid dripping from the roots of the tree. There is a cave with a staircase from the center of the boulder towards the top of the boulder. We learn that the rock is a temple to [[Ubtoa]] called the “[[Heart of Ubtoa]]”. We call out and speak with [[Valendra]]. She opens a portal and we are teleported up to the top of the rock.

On top of the boulder there are bookcases, puddles and a large iron cage. The cave room is quite small. We suspect that she is a red wizard but she says she is a researcher. Pandora casts a “charm person” spell on [[Valendra]] and it fails. [[Valendra]] says that we should be nice. She asks us to find any sightings of the undead so she can triangulate their source. We share maps and learn more about our surrounding area.

[[Indy]] and [[Pandora]] tell EVERYTHING to the suspected [[red wizards]].

[[Valendra]] teaches a secret handshake to show other wizards that we are friends. We decide to head to the shipwreck in the trees. On the way we ask [[Eku]] about [[Kir Sabal]]. She says that is where the [[Aarakokra]] are located. They are kind of a holy order. 

We arrived safely at the shipwreck in the trees. A wooden vessel is high in the trees broken into 3 chunks. It doesn’t look like a sea faring vessel.
