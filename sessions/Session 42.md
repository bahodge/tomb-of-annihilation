[[Khara]] drinks the "supreme large potion" that we found in the room. She immediately takes poison damage. Luckily he isn't poisoned. We lay [[Cyan]] to rest in the sarcophagus.

We push and pull and try to open the door to get out of the room. At the midpoint of the hallway. We find a bottle with a person in it. [[Munch]] lets them out of the bottle. We ask her name and she says [[Keshma Al Wazir]] and she was trapped by [[Az'Sarak]]. She was pissed about it and wants to help us smite [[Az'Sarak]]. 

We continue through the hallway. We are told that we should shatter the bottle when we need her. She disappears.

We open the secret door and kill a skeleton and some zombies. We find a sarcophagus with a crane on it.
