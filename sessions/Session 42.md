## Level 2

[[Khara]] drinks the "supreme large potion" that we found in the room. She immediately takes poison damage. Luckily he isn't poisoned. We lay [[Cyan]] to rest in the sarcophagus.

We push and pull and try to open the door to get out of the room. At the midpoint of the hallway. We find a bottle with a person in it. [[Munch]] lets them out of the bottle. We ask her name and she says [[Keshma Al Wazir]] and she was trapped by [[Az'Sarak]]. She was pissed about it and wants to help us smite [[Az'Sarak]]. 

We continue through the hallway. We are told that we should shatter the bottle when we need her. She disappears.

We open the secret door and kill a skeleton and some zombies. We find a sarcophagus with a crane on it. [[Indy]] touches it and a bunch of skeletons appear out of the cauldrons. We kill all the skeltons.

We find
- golden torc (neck ornament) 250gp
- 3 beautiful golden cups 75gp/ea
- 5 gold cloak pins 25gp/ea
- Golden amulet

[[Khara]] touches the amulet and a shadowy crane appears. [[Khara]] is possessed by the spirit and drops the mace. [[Khara]] is now even more pristine. We throw the mace in the bag of holding.

-  Item usages
	- 4 explosive arrows

We take a short rest
## Level 3

We decend to the third floor and encounter a fungus with eyestalks creeping out. [[Munch]] chops one of the eyestalks as it tries to charm her. Other eyestalks appear. [[Merrick]] explores further and finds a jackal carving. She looks through it and finds that the death slide from level 2 drops into a chamber with a sarcophagus decorated with [[almiraj]]. A dwarf enters the room and triggers a pressure plate and is devoured by a swarm of insects.

We continue down a hallway with 2 tomb guardians. [[Merrick]] is able sneak by. [[Khara]]'s but hits the chain and the tomb guardians are alerted. We fight the tomb guardians.

We kill the tomb guardians and move to a door. We open the door and find a tapestry depicting nobles. We move the first tapestry which shows nobles enjoying a feast. We move and see the second one which is the nobles are depraved. We move the second tapestry and it scares [[Munch]].
