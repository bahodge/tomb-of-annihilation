We take the [[Vorn]] controller to [[Vorn]].

Pandora’s egg hasn’t spoiled. [[Indy]] powers up [[Vorn]] who asks us to find some power crystals in a nearby mine.

Travel to the mine

Day 32

We arrive at the entrance to the abandoned mine. The mine has a sign in the front of the mine saying property of [[Trade Prince Zhan'ti]].

We kill a bunch of spiders. And harvest them and get a poison gland, a spider eye and a vial of blood. [[Indy]] does some cool flips across a chasm and we try to fight a massive rock monster. Find a strange club on a body surrounded by mushrooms. We fight many scary bugs and find a mine cart. We continue up the hill
