We start out the day exiting the tunnel and divide up all the gems amongst the party to transport them back to [[Vorn]]. 

It takes 4 days for us to move back to [[Camp Vengeance]]. We arrive at the camp and are received by [[Commander Niles Breakbone]]. We inform them that [[Emery]] has likely died. Jr is awarded the Gauntlets of Throwdown. Munch stores the silence spell in [[Vorn]].

We wake up the first day and [[Munch]] steals a sword dressed as a halfling order of the gauntlet from the camp and we head towards [[Dungrunglung]].


We arrived at [[Dungrunglung]]. There is a clearing, a massive wall and a large statue of the head of a frog. [[G’roak]] is the leader of a [[Grung]] patrol. They point us in the direction to exit a giant hedge maze. We fight our way through the maze, killing some poisonous vines. We find a secret exit and exit the maze.

As we exit the maze, we cross a massive pond. We are led to [[G’roak]] (king) and [[Roark]] (military commander). We meet with [[G’roak]], who is impressed by our ability to reanimate [[Vorn]]. He asks us to help summon [[Queen Nang Nang]].

[[Krr’ook]], a wizard-like red [[Grung]] approaches us. She asks us to help with the summoning. We are going to need an image of [[Queen Nang Nang]]. She gives us magical animation pigments to help with this. 

Current plan on summoning:
- Pandora turns into toad
- [[Munch]] or [[Jr]] cast disguise
- We do the ceremony and cyan casts pyrotechnics, alter self, and skywrite.

[[Munch]] wants to talk to the [[Grung]] prisoners.
