We go to the bazaar and trade with the kobolds. We then go to speak with the red wizards. We agree to help the wizards and they heal [[organ damage]] on [[Munch]].

we rest and then go to the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]].

We get to the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. We then solve a puzzle and enter the western gate into the tomb. 

[[Khar]] and [[Indy]] break a window and steal some masks. They distribute the masks to the party. Everyone dawns the masks. [[Khar]] touches a sarcophagus and acts weird. We continue exploring and come across another sarcophagus and [[Merrick Ravenshade]] opens the sarcophagus and takes staff. She totally is cursed AF.

We walk down some stairs into a river. We move down the river and kill a skeleton. We continue down the river and discover a chest hanging 1 foot above the water.
