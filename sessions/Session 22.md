[[Jr]] is dead and we have killed the 4 people that were here to speak with us. The captain of [[Sturge]] asked us why we killed them and we said why.

We loot [[Jr]]'s body
- 26 silver
- 7 copper
- Dueling gloves 
- Circlet of blasting
- Bottle of Tje wine
- 1â€“50 gold friendship ring ([[Indy]] has the other one)
- 1 healing potion

We also loot the first mate.
- spear
- a shield
- a brass spyglass

We board [[Sturge]]. The captain says that the captain of the [[Emerald Eye]] has been slacking on their duty and the [[Sturge]] was doing most of the hard work. He asks us to help us take down the [[Emerald Eye]]. We learn the name of the captain of [[Sturge]] is [[Captain Laskilar]]. He says that we are going to be locked in the brig until we arrive near the cove. He captain of the [[Emerald Eye]] is an an undead wight.

We are introduced to the crew and the [[Tide Sage Umberly]]. We agree to the pirate captain's plan.

[[Jumal]] was promoted to first mate of the [[Sturge]].

We escape the cell, kill [[Captain Laskilar]] and take over the [[Sturge]]. We now are in charge of [[Taban's Big Deck]] and the [[Sturge]]. [[Pandora]] is now Captain of the [[Sturge]].

We decide that we want to speak to the [[Dragon Fang]] and try and convince them to join us against the [[Emerald Eye]]. We think that we can convince the captain of the [[Dragon Fang]] to join us by promising them booty.

We sail to [[Jahaka Bay]] where the [[Emerald Eye]] should be moored. Pirate Queen [[Pandora]] wants to relive the [[Dragon Fang]] and assume the role of guard for [[Jahaka Bay]].

We take a beach day and have a proper funeral for [[Jr]]. We cremate him (BBQ style). 

- "Losing people makes me sad and I even liked him a bit" - [[Pandora]]
- "I don't intend to learn anything from [[Jr]], but... no I don't think I should follow his example. I guess he has taught me something, how best not to die. He was a brave member of the [[Dinoseurs]]. Whenever i'm getting my ass kicked i'll think of [[Jr]]" - [[Indy]]
- "I will forever cherish this scale sample from [[Jr]]." - [[Cyan]]
- "you would have made a good slave" - [[Munch]]

[[Cyan]] also notices some very distinct looking birthmarks on [[Jr]]'s body. This was the first true death of a party member and [[Pandora]] is sad. We store [[Jr]]'s ashes in a bottle of [[Tej wine]]. We have a party on the beach and have a great night. [[Munch]]'s bugs feast on the charred remains of [[Jr]] and start to metamorphose into something different that no one has seen before.

The crew looks rejuvenated and healthier. The next day we head on to the boat.

We each now are wearing eye patches and looking. We learn that wearing eye patches is required to enter the vault at [[Jahaka Anchorage]]. 

We continue sailing to [[Jahaka Anchorage]]. We learn that the entrance to the bay is treacherous. We enter the bay.

[[Dry Tortuga]] is the name of [[Pandora]]'s new [[ankylosaurus]]. We also have a single chest of booty to deliver to the vault. 

We decide to pretend like we belong and use dingys to go to [[Bosco's Bilge]]. We leave the ships with [[Jumal]] and [[Tide Sage Umberly]] as well as 2 minions.

As we approach the conoa dock, we see a person tied up being eaten by crabs and sharks in the water. Turns out we forgot the captain's key to the vault. We go back and grab the key for the vault. We deliver the booty to the vault and it turns out to not be that much booty inside.

We head to [[Bosco's Bilge]] for a drink and now [[Pandora]] is a captain again. As we enter the tavern, [[Bosco]] yells at his pet dino. [[Indy]] begins to sow decent in the tavern. [[Pandora]] and [[Indy]] buy drinks for everyone. Since the [[Emerald Eye]] is crewed by undead, they cut into the margins for the [[Bosco's Bilge]] tavern. 

We offer a third of booty for the help killing the entire crew of the [[Emerald Eye]].

Next Time:
- kill the [[Emerald Eye]] crew
- kill [[Captain Zaroum Al-Saryak]]
- possibly get a new member of the team.
