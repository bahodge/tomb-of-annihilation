## Wyrmrest Mine

We continue down the tunnel to [[Wyrmheart Mine]]. In the distance we hear fighting. [[Pandora]] opens up on a group of battling spiders and [[kobold]]s. We kill all of them and continue to the main cavern. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] walks into the main hall and starts singing to attract a bunch of flying [[kobold]]s. Fails pretty hard and we are attacked.

We kill a bunch more [[kobold]]s and one of them goes to grab [[Dragon Tinder]]. We try to talk our way out of it but [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] opens fire and starts combat with the dragon.

[[Vorn]] is able to grapple the dragon and drag it into the path of a massive boulder launched by [[kobold]]s on the upper levels. The boulder came crashing down and kills the [[Dragon Tinder]].
