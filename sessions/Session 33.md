## Garden Palace of Nangalor

A beautiful land mass surrounded by swamp. Lots of gardens with a large gazeebo and very pretty but overgrown. We remember to avoid the "queen's sight". We land at the front entrance.

Looking into the palace we see gardens and many statues. Lots of untamed overgrowth.
