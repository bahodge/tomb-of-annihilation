As we board the ship [[Indy]] notices that one of his hands starts going grey. He feels cursed. [[Indy]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] try to decipher the tablet rubbing. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] validates that common translation.

## Garden Palace of Nangalor

A beautiful land mass surrounded by swamp. Lots of gardens with a large gazeebo and very pretty but overgrown. We remember to avoid the "queen's sight". We land at the front entrance.

Looking into the palace we see gardens and many statues. Lots of untamed overgrowth.

In the gazeebo we see a massive warrior statue. The face of the warrior has been obliterated by deep gouges. [[Indy]] begins translating a plaque. He translates it to. Warrior placard reads: “True love, faithful general, safe will you rest in Nangalore eternal. None will disturb you while I live. Such is my vow of penance, and for my sins I cannot die.” 

[[Pandora]] and [[Cyan]] go and inspect the broken water wheel. Out of the water wheel spouts a [[chawinga]] and splashes in the water. It is very impressed with how tall [[Pandora]] is and dances around her. It splashes her with magic dust and [[Pandora]] feels blessed.

[[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] helps translate some plaques to help [[Indy]] under some stone faces with different expressions.

1. bemused expression. The message above it reads, “This garden is dedicated to Zalkoré, queen of Omu and jewel of Chult.”
2. condescending expression. The message above it reads, “Worshiped by her people and by Thiru-taya, who crossed-out:loves BETRAYED her.”
3. stern expression. The message above it reads, “In this, the tenth year of her reign, may she govern forever in splendor.”
4. serene expression. The message above it reads, “And may the gods themselves marvel at this humble reflection of her beauty.”

We see a small message carved into the bottom of the statue and it says "forgive me". 

[[Indy]] translates the plaque under a statue and it looks like it is a orc barbarian turned to stone. As we are exploring the garden, [[Indy]] is attacked by a [[maneater]] and we begin fighting many garden plants.
