[[Merrick Ravenshade]] uses the mage hand and collects a ring. We walk up to the door with Omuan writing above.

[[Khar]] takes the key and jams it in and a stone door opens. Inside the shrine we see steps decending to a ledge overlooking sharpened stakes and an alcove on the far wall holds a pedestal with a cube atop it. Wooden beams radiate from the walls at floor hight.

[[Merrick Ravenshade]] tries to grab the stone with mage hand but the door smashes shut. A wave of poison leaks out and we almost get poisoned. [[Indy]] jumps across the threshold and does an indiana jones idol swap. He picks up the stone cube with iconography of the Froghemoth.

## Sector 13

This sector is the back of the compound with gates. We spend 30 minutes exploring it and come across a large metal circle. It looks like a disc. There are two holes in the hole. [[Khar]] opens the manhole and sees that there is some stagnant water. The pipes turn towards the city. We make note of the entrance to the sewers and head to sector 14.

## Sector 14

We see a raised stone road cutting through the city. There are noises coming from the northern road and we see a group of [[kobold]]s walking down the road. 

[[Munch]] approaches the [[kobold]]s and asks to speak to their manager and they point to the ruined bazar
