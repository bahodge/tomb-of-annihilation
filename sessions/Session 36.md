## Sector 9

[[Merrick Ravenshade]] uses the mage hand and collects a ring. We walk up to the door with Omuan writing above. 

> "Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take.‚Äù

[[Khar]] takes the key and jams it in and a stone door opens. Inside the shrine we see steps decending to a ledge overlooking sharpened stakes and an alcove on the far wall holds a pedestal with a cube atop it. Wooden beams radiate from the walls at floor hight.

[[Merrick Ravenshade]] tries to grab the stone with mage hand but the door smashes shut.
