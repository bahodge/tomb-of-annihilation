## Sector 12

[[Merrick Ravenshade]] uses the mage hand and collects a ring. We walk up to the door with Omuan writing above. 

> "[[Kubazan]] urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take.”

[[Khar]] takes the key and jams it in and a stone door opens. Inside the shrine we see steps decending to a ledge overlooking sharpened stakes and an alcove on the far wall holds a pedestal with a cube atop it. Wooden beams radiate from the walls at floor hight.

[[Merrick Ravenshade]] tries to grab the stone with mage hand but the door smashes shut. A wave of poison leaks out and we almost get poisoned. [[Indy]] jumps across the threshold and does an indiana jones idol swap. He picks up the stone cube with iconography of the Froghemoth.

## Sector 13

This sector is the back of the compound with gates. We spend 30 minutes exploring it and come across a large metal circle. It looks like a disc. There are two holes in the hole. [[Khar]] opens the manhole and sees that there is some stagnant water. The pipes turn towards the city. We make note of the entrance to the sewers and head to sector 14.

## Sector 14

We see a raised stone road cutting through the city. There are noises coming from the northern road and we see a group of [[kobold]]s walking down the road. 

[[Munch]] approaches the [[kobold]]s and asks to speak to their manager and they point to the ruined bazzar towards the north east.

## Sector 19

We see buildings but one very tall building stands out. We walk towards the tall building and don't see anything. [[Munch]] climbs the tower and looks towards the east and sees the river and a large tree. To the west, she sees a large metal disc in the ground. To the south she sees what she thinks is the [[Shemagi's Shrine]]. We take a short rest.

## Sector 25

We look around the area. We find a building containing a carving depicting a carving of a massive serpent eating it's own tail surrounding a globe of [[Torrel]]. We also find the the remains of a dissected dwarf. [[Khar]] is overwhelmed by the sight and he becomes paralyzed. [[Indy]] catches him as he falls. We explore the ruin and see that the body was dissected very thoroughly.

## Sector 30

We search the area and find some pillars. A pair of stone doors provide entry to a large ruined building. [[Munch]] pushes [[Cyan]] forward. As we walk in we see thecutest bunny with a unicorn horn scurry under some bushes. We find a bunny burroughs. [[Cyan]] sticks his hand into the hole and feels around. He tries to lure the rabbit out of the burrow and he is able to lure the [[almiraj]]. He tells us this is the [[Shrine of I'gin]]. She was a [[almiraj]]. They say that they have seen people go in and out of the shrine. I'gin was trickster god.

[[Cyan]] lets the rabbit go and [[Khar]] snaps its neck. We take the horn. We approach the door and see an inscription. "I’jin teaches us to take the path least expected." [[Indy]] looks for an entrance and [[Khar]] opens the doors. Carved tiles depicting beasts on the floor. [[Khar]] brute forces it and gets fucked up. Then [[Indy]] solves the puzzle and we follow him across.

We reach a T intersection. We go left and reach another T intersection. [[Munch]] uses arrows to help remember how to get out of the maze. [[Indy]] takes the cube.

We decide to spend the night in a tiny hut so we continue moving forwards.

## Sector 37

During our searching we find a ruin that contains the remenants of a campsite for 1 dozen people. There are bodies of mercenaries, theyans and [[Yuan-ti]]. We find a mirror that is cracked and really cool. There are arcane glyphs on the mirror.

We take a long rest and cook the rabbit meat.

As we awake, we hear loud and loud footsteps approaching us. A massive T-rex busts through the ceiling. WE FIGHT!!! We kill the dinosaurs and harvest the hide and 4 bones of non-descript size. We killed what we think is the [[King of Feathers]]
