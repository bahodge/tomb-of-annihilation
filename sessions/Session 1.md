We begin our journey at the docks of [[Baldur’s Gate]] along side of a ship called the Brazen Pegasus. Emery and Junior meet for the first time officially. We meet an Autognome, C.Y.A.N. representing the Emerald Enclave. We also meet Indikasha ([[Indy]]), a fighter who is from the Lord’s Alliance. He’s clad in leather armor and a Steson hat and carrying a scimitar and and whip. We meet Pandora (don’t shorten it) and she is a tall dark Teifling working for the Emerald Enclave. Pandora doesn’t seem particularly thrilled to be forced to go to Chult.

Roles

[[Emery]] is a Cleric
[[Jr]] is a Paladin
[[Cyan]] is an Chemical Artificer
[[Pandora]] is a Druid
[[Indy]] is a dex fighter

  
We meet [[Ortime the Swift and Dark]], the captain of the [[Brazen Pegasus]]. [[Grig Ruddle]] is the first mate. We are told our patron, [[Syndra Silvayn]] is below deck. [[Syndra Silvayn]] is an undead patron funding our expedition.

We speak with [[Syndra Silvayn|Syndra]] where we learn that the dead are honored. She used to be a renowned adventurer where she was killed but brought back. 

[[Jr]], was headed to [[Camp Righteous]], but it was wiped out some time ago. 

  

[[Indy]] is looking for Artis Symber but no one has seen him. Artis is a famous explorer. [[Indy]] thinks that the map he is carrying is related to him. The seas around [[Port Nyanzahru]] is guarded by a giant turtle, [[Arameg]] who demands tolls for passage.

If we ever need to meet with [[Syndra Silvayn]], we can find her with the [[Trade Prince Wakanga Otamu]].
  

[[Chult]] was once ruled over by a king and queen until they became erratic. They were overthrown by the 7 [[trade merchants]]. The trade princes are always trying make more money so we likely can deal with them for our expeditions into the jungle.

  

Rules: You must pay a license to go into the jungle and to enter back into the city you must pay a fee to the [[Flaming Fists]] upon your return. Try not to kill any herbivore dinosaurs.

  

We learn that the undead menace began a month ago. There was another group hired from a mercenary company a while ago but they went into the jungle and were never seen again.

  

On the third day of our ship ride to Port Nyanzaru, a storm begins to form and we begin to sail into it. We survive the storm and level up.
