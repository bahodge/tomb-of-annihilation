## Level 6

We engage with a dust [[mephit]] and murder it. We continue exploring the room. We figure out how to pull the lever. We hear some grinding.

 We ask the little figures for help to read the book. The little monkey one (joho) offers to help. We promise to help them. We learn the [[Hags Swin Sisters]] are not good people. They are somehow related to the cause of all the undead.

The little figures offer us boons
- [[Merrick]] you can cast etherealness
- [[Khara]] remove the requirements to eat/drink/breath
- [[Munch]] understand languages

[[Merrick]] smashes the bottle that [[Keshma Al Wazir]] resided in. We try to use our wish. We wish for a long rest.

We tell [[Keshma Al Wazir]] she can reside in the vinegar of the alchemy jug. [[Munch]] reads the scary book and the final trial is completed. We go back up stairs realizing that we can't find the last skeleton head needed to open the door.

## Level 5

[[Merrick]] pulls a lever in the control room and the room starts flooding with slime. We run away and leave the slime running.

## Level 4

We find a room with some artists and some paintings. there is a gross throne made out of skin and bones. [[Merrick]] uses etherealness and just looks for the skeleton and bypasses the puzzel. She litterally uses fireball and compeltely annihilates the poor skeleton who looked at her with puppy eyes as she cast it.

We head back to level 5.

## Level 5

We figure out the way to turn off the slime and get the rod out of the mastadon's head.

Everything lights on fire and some devils come out to die to us.
