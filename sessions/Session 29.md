We start our session after murdering a bunch of tied up creatures and the forge sounds all stop. We continue killing [[fire newts]] around the forge. We kill many but they kept on heating the forge until it exploded into a giant [[fire elemental]]. We ended the session about to fight a ton more [[fire newts]] that were uncovered behind a door.

Next Time:
- kill the rest of the [[fire newts]]
- don't die
