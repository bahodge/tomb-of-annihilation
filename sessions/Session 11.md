Day 5-7

We continued down the river, riding our canoas towards [[Camp Vengeance]].

Day 8

We arrive at [[Camp Vengeance]]. We dock our boats on the shore and approach the camp from the riverbank. We meet [[Ord Firebeard]], captain of the watch. Ord says that Niles Breakbone overestimated his ability to lead an expedition into the jungle. 

We enter the commander’s tent where we see [[Commander Niles Breakbone]]. We also meet [[Lorsa Bilwatal]], a local Chultan. [[Sister Cyas]] is the local cleric but she can’t cast spells. They are attacked by [[Goblins]] and [[Grung]]s. They captured a bunch of soldiers that we wanted to rescue.

We meet [[Sister Cyas]], and she tells us that many of the wounded are suffering from blue mist fever. We heal and restore all of the soldiers with [[Miss Silvertusk]]. The albino dwarves, are followers of Kalimvor.

We help around the camp and make a deal with [[Sister Cyas]] for mosquito candles. 

The gauntlets of grasping grace, pull an ally that is within 60ft closer to you your proficiency per day. 

We get more information about where the goblins are that kidnapped the soldiers. [[Pandora]] and [[Jr]] dance and perform for the soldiers at night to increase morale. [[Indy]] and [[Pandora]] do another performance where he jumps around the palisades with his whip. Everyone is very impressed.

Day 9-11

We wake up and head towards the goblins. And bring everyone including [[Captain Taban]] and [[Eku]]. We fight some young allosauruses and harvest some ankylosaurus eggs.

Day 12-14
We arrive at a giant statue made of wood and adamantine. Around it’s feet are food and skulls. We track goblin tracks for 4 days. We meet some goblins in the trees around the goblin camp. They take us to their camp and we meet [[Queen Grabstab]]. She controls a button or switch named inscribed with “vorn”. She charges us to find and kill dinos or undead.
