[[Tej grapes]] are worth 10gp per pound.

We inspect the bodies of the and determine that they were likely originally killed by large bites. We infer that they were bitten with large fangs. We determined that it was likely a large reptile with fangs. We ask our guide about the bites and he describes [[Yuan-ti]], a snake people that roam these lands.

We decided to go look for more ghouls deeper into the jungle. [[Pandora]] finds a [[yacha beetle]] while scavenging for food and adopts it as a pet. If you eat the beetle, it can cure blue mist fever. If we ever come across blue mist in the jungle, we should run away.

We encounter a group of ghouls being spoken to by a large snake creature. We kill all the ghouls and harvest their heads. We headed back to [[Fort Beluarian]] and came across some large footprints. We get Jrâ€™s arm splinted at the temple. We turn in all the ghoul heads and get gold. Buy/sell equipment.

- Giant footprints
- Quest to find out what happened to the people who went missing
