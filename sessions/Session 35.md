We begin by looting [[Queen Zelkor]] and harvest 1 vial of [[medusa saliva]] that has the properties of removing petrification.

- 7 assorted gemstones worth 10gp each
- a co'atl bracelet
- a wooden scroll tube decorated with skeletons
- we find a tincture of dreaming

[[Munch]] begins decorating the dead bodies of [[Pandora]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn|Lorenzo]]. [[Indy]] takes [[Pandora]]'s spell casting focus. 

We speak with an unpetrified paladin who convinces us to use the medusa head to unpetrify a very handsome bugbear. He is carrying a bow and two shortswords. The bugbear is likely a hick. He introduces himself as [[Khar]].

We ask [[Khar]] what he can do. He says he is pretty good with a bow. We ask how he got here and he says that the [[Trade Princes]] told him to investigate the undead menace but it didn't work.

We walk towards the the [[Star Goddess]] with [[Khar]] and the bodies and hear a scream for help in the forest. We find a very pretty but very young 16 year old human girl with red hair. She looks very dirty and gross.

We lure the child with with candy out of a tree. [[Indy]] asks if she is hiding from someone and she says that she was separated and freaked out and word vomitted. She was with the [[Emerald Enclave]] looking for the cause of the undead menace as punished. She is named [[Merrick Ravenshade]].

We embark on the [[Star Goddess]] and fly to [[Camp Vengeance]] to heal [[Munch]] and [[Indy]].

## Camp Vengeance

We arrive at the camp and speak with [[Sister Cyas]] and get healed. We plan out how we are going to [[Lost City of Omu]] and look for the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. We fly the [[Vorn Crystal Mine]] to bury [[Pandora]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn|Lorenzo]]. 

[[Merrick Ravenshade]] talks us into the mine. We respectfully yeet [[Pandora]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]]. We say some beautiful memories about them. We take 20 crystals and head back to [[Port Nyanzahru]] to pick up [[Vorn]].

## Port Nyanzahru

We arrive fully refreshed and glistening at the [[Port Nyanzahru]]. The party goes to the bathouse and bath to strategise about [[Lost City of Omu]]. We go shopping.

## Omu

We fly to [[Lost City of Omu]] and try to land on the south side near a staircase. A ruined city drenched in a swollen river. A ruined palace lies a few hundred feet near the steaming gash. 

[[Munch]] tries to plant the acorn outside the city but it jumps out of the hole. We continue down the stairs towards the guardhouse. We are able to squeeze under the gate.

We go to the guardhouse and much of the interior is rubble. Covered in vines and graffiti with painted.

“Fear the fangs of Ras Nsi!”
“Erik, I’ve gone in search of the nine shrines. V.”
“The puzzle cubes are the key.”
“Beware the frog monster!”
“Who is Unkh?”
“All hail the King of Feathers!”
“The snakes are not what they seem.”
“Kubazan = bravery. Shagambi = wisdom. Moa = ?”

We are ambushed by a bunch of snake people. They look similar to [[Raj'nisi]]. We kill all of them. Our guide [[Selida]] says that they are [[Yuan-ti]] and is impressed that we've killed them.

We loot:
- 3 longbows carved like snakes

We are moving to hex 2

We see signs of a fight and see some goblin
