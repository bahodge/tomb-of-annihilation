We begin by looting [[Queen Zelkor]] and harvest 1 vial of [[medusa saliva]] that has the properties of removing petrification.

- 7 assorted gemstones worth 10gp each
- a co'atl bracelet
- a wooden scroll tube decorated with skeletons
- we find a tincture of dreaming

[[Munch]] begins decorating the dead bodies of [[Pandora]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn|Lorenzo]]. [[Indy]] takes [[Pandora]]'s spell casting focus. 

We speak with an unpetrified paladin who convinces us to use the medusa head to unpetrify a very handsome bugbear. He is carrying a bow and two shortswords. The bugbear is likely a hick. He introduces himself as [[Khar]].

We ask [[Khar]] what he can do. He says he is pretty good with a bow. We ask how he got here and he says that the [[Trade Princes]] told him to investigate the undead menace but it didn't work.

We walk towards the the [[Star Goddess]] with [[Khar]] and the bodies and hear a scream for help in the forest. We find a very pretty but very young 16 year old human girl with red hair. She looks very dirty and gross.

We lure the child with with candy out of a tree. [[Indy]] asks if she is hiding from someone and she says that she was separated and freaked out and word vomitted. She was with the [[Emerald Enclave]] looking for the cause of the undead menace as punished. She is named [[Merrick Ravenshade]].
