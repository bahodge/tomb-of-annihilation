## Shilku

We start in [[Shilku]] and [[Munch]]'s ants eats some dragon meat. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] now is an emo warlock. He respecs to pact of the tomb. The ants consume the dragon's breath pouch and now they all be consumed to cast wall of fire.

We spend the night in [[Shilku]]. We step the the portal and go to [[Port Nyanzahru]].

## Port Nyanzahru

We see [[Oculeth]]. He is happy. We tell [[Oculeth]] that we slayed the [[Dragon Tinder]]. We ask about the [[colesseum]] was closed. We head to the crew of the [[Star Goddess]] to help them out. As we walk towards the [[colesseum]], there is much less foot traffic. We think that [[The Grey]] has spread into the city. 

## Port Nyanzahru Colesseum

We arrive and there big signs saying that the [[colesseum]] is closed. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] coughs and the guard outside freaks out. We walk inside and look for [[Akina Afa]]. We convince the guard to let us in.

We see [[Akina Afa]]. We produce the Adamantine, tanned dragon skin and the elemental core. She offers to us to be able to use the ship to go into the jungle. We give her 60lbs of Adamantine ingots, the fire source. We have 40lbs of adamantine ingots left. 

[[Akina Afa]] tells us that there is a weapon in the [[Lost City of Omu]]. It is a dagger. She thinks that it is rumored to be called the [[Eye of Zaltec]]. [[Pandora]] negotiates that if we bring [[Akina Afa]] the [[Eye of Zaltec]], she will let us choose to have a weapon from her personal collection. She says that it will take 1 week to fix up the [[Star Goddess]].

[[Pandora]] asks why there is no one about the town. As people have been turning grey. Anyone who fights that has [[The Grey]] cannot be healed or resurrected. Thus forcing the [[colesseum]] to close.

## Downtime Activity

We shop around and steal some stuff. We spend the week at the [[Thundering Lizard]] for 1gp/night.

[[Munch]] goes to the bath house and takes a bath.

## Thundering Lizard

We ask one of the guides if they can take us to the [[Lost City of Omu]]. Her name is [[Selida]]. She agrees to take us.

[[Munch]] goes to buy poison from [[Trade Princess Jesamine]] but she is dead and her daughter is now the trade princess. [[Trade Princesses Ymezra]]
