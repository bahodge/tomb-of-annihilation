## Shilku

We start in [[Shilku]] and [[Munch]]'s ants eats some dragon meat. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] now is an emo warlock. He respecs to pact of the tomb. The ants consume the dragon's breath pouch and now they all be consumed to cast wall of fire.

We spend the night in [[Shilku]]. We step the the portal and go to [[Port Nyanzahru]].

## Port Nyanzahru

We see [[Oculeth]]. He is happy. We tell [[Oculeth]] that we slayed the [[Dragon Tinder]]. We ask about the [[colesseum]] was closed. We head to the crew of the [[Star Goddess]] to help them out. As we walk towards the [[colesseum]], there is much less foot traffic. We think that [[The Grey]] has spread into the city. 

## Port Nyanzahru Colesseum

We arrive and there big signs saying that the [[colesseum]] is closed. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] coughs and the guard outside freaks out. We walk inside and look for [[Akina Afa]]. We convince the guard to let us in.

We see [[Akina Afa]]. We produce the Adamantine, tanned dragon skin and the elemental core. She offers to us to be able to use the ship to go into the jungle. We give her 60lbs of Adamantine ingots, the fire source. We have 40lbs of adamantine ingots left. 

[[Akina Afa]] tells us that there is a weapon in the [[Lost City of Omu]]. It is a dagger. She thinks that it is rumored to be called the [[Eye of Zaltec]]. [[Pandora]] negotiates that if we bring [[Akina Afa]] the [[Eye of Zaltec]], she will let us choose to have a weapon from her personal collection. She says that it will take 1 week to fix up the [[Star Goddess]].

[[Pandora]] asks why there is no one about the town. As people have been turning grey. Anyone who fights that has [[The Grey]] cannot be healed or resurrected. Thus forcing the [[colesseum]] to close.

## Downtime Activity

We shop around and steal some stuff. We spend the week at the [[Thundering Lizard]] for 1gp/night.

[[Munch]] goes to the bath house and takes a bath.

We ask one of the guides if they can take us to the [[Lost City of Omu]]. Her name is [[Selida]]. She agrees to take us.

[[Munch]] goes to buy poison from [[Trade Princess Jesamine]] but she is dead and her daughter is now the trade princess. We buy some drow poison from  [[Trade Princesses Ymezra]].

We go to [[Trade Prince Zhan'ti]] and sell all the bolts of silk and loom for 2000gp. We also sell all of our other wares.  We go to the bonesmith and craft a new dragon short bow for [[Munch]].

[[Pandora]] mercilessly killed [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]]'s skeleton helpers. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] respecs from skelli summoner spell to grasp of hadar.

## Port Nyanzahru Colesseum

We decide to head the the [[Garden Palace of Nangalor]] with [[Selida]] on the [[Star Goddess]].  We head to [[Mezro]] to to find [[Artis Cymber]] since it is on the way.

## Mezro

We fly to [[Mezro]]. The city is abandoned. We land in the middle of the city on the main temple. As we land we see no movement at all. We ask [[Selida]] if [[Mezro]] was a busselling city but learn that it hasn't been for a long time. The [[Flaming Fists]] ransacked the city. We go into the central temple area.

We find a giant tablet that says "Queen Napaka proclaims that the free people of Omu fear nothing. Brave new gods protect us, as Ubtao did before but does no longer. Omu will rise again, and Napaka shall reclaim all that is hers by right of conquest."

[[Indy]] takes a paper and charcoal and copies the message. We look around and see a trail cut into the foliage that had overgrown the forest.

We follow the trail to a building but see that someone was here maybe a month ago. It is [[Artis Cymber]]'s house. We find a note written by [[Artis Cymber]] that says that there is no change in [[Mezro]] and that he has gone to [[Oralunga]] for answers.

We fly west to [[Dungrunglung]] and see that it was burned down. They were likely killed by a horde undead. We saw that the King [[G’roak]] is dead. We don't see [[Roark]] or [[Krr’ook]]. We continue to [[Oralunga]].

## Oralunga

As we are sailing towards the [[zigurat]], we are unable to approach it from the sky. So we decide to land. We decide to scale up the [[zigurat]]. We climb up the the first few feet, but are unable to reach the top. [[Pandora]] uses her cloak and teleports her and and [[Munch]] to the top of the [[zigurat]]. We are unable to teleport to the top and we see a new [[chawinga]]. It scurries into the forest. [[Pandora]] was able to communicate with the [[chawinga]]. We look around for some orchids. We proceed up the stairs using the orchids.

We reach the second level but the stairs look very rickety. [[Pandora]] turns into a red parrot and we violently rip some feathers out of her wings. We climb up the steps. We remember a story about [[chawinga]]s and bonk snakes with the orchid and tickle them with a feather and then it slithers into our mouth. We all slither up to the top level of the [[zigurat]].

We enter the temple at the top of the [[zigurat]]. An immense snake is inside. It says it's name is [[Saja n'baza]]. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] asks where [[Artis Cymber]] is. They said that he went to [[Lost City of Omu]] to rid the world of [[Raj'nisi]]. 

We ask the snake

1. [[Indy]] asks Where is [[Artis Cymber]]. [[Lost City of Omu]].
2. [[Munch]] asks How do we stop [[The Grey]]. It has something to do with the [[Lost City of Omu]].
3. [[Pandora]] Who is taking our body parts? That sounds like the work of the [[Hags Swin Sisters]].
4. [[Cyan]]Where can we find the parts to heal [[Cyan]]'s master? [[Garden Palace of Nangalor]] but beware the Queen's sight.
5. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] is [[Nanny Pu'Pu]] a hag? She is a hag.

We run out of questions but the threat of [[Raj'nisi]] must be dealt with. We promise [[Saja n'baza]] that we will kill them.

- [[Munch]] is granted the switcharoo charm
- [[Pandora]] is granted the selfless charm
- [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] is granted the challengers charm
- [[Indy]] is granted the charm of far reach
- [[Cyan]] is granted the panic charm

We exit the temple and a massive shimmer happens. We head back to the [[Star Goddess]]. We speak with [[Nanny Pu'Pu]].

[[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]], [[Pandora]] and [[Munch]] confront [[Nanny Pu'Pu]]. We ask what she is and she admits to being a hag. We mention the [[Hags Swin Sisters]], and she spits on the ground. She admits she takes our body parts and we believe she is a [[Hags Swin Sisters]], and on that she teleports away.
