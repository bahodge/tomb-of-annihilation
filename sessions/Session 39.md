## Sector 28

 We search the area and find the [[Obelack]] shrine.  We do our secret snake handshake and head towards the shrine. We see a man and he is being attacked by 4 bears. The man looks familiar. He is the red wizard's guide. We intimidate the [[Zorbos]] and they scurry away

We talk to the guide and he says they have 2 cubes but the red wizard who was carrying it was petrified.

They have [[Shagambi]]'s cube and [[Moze]]'s cube.
