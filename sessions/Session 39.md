## Sector 28

 We search the area and find the [[Obelack]] shrine.  We do our secret snake handshake and head towards the shrine. We see a man and he is being attacked by 4 bears. The man looks familiar. He is the red wizard's guide. We intimidate the [[Zorbos]] and they scurry away. The guide's name is [[Orvex]]

We talk to the guide and he says they have 2 cubes but the red wizard who was carrying it was petrified. We learn that he was petrified as he picked up the cube.

They have [[Shagambi]]'s cube and [[Moa]]'s cube.

Inside of the shrine, there are walls and lit with torches. The corridors is painted with Omu'en reliefs depicting normal life. There is also some writing.

"[[Obelack]] teaches us to tread warily and stay in the light"

We pick up the petrified man and take him out of the tomb. We unpetrify him with the [[medusa saliva]]. We wrestle 1 of his 2 cubes away and get the cube of [[Obelack]]. He is named [[Voj]]. We don't tell them that we know where other shrines are.


## Sector 26
 
We search the area and look for [[Unk]]'s shrine. We see swirling carvings and see the entrance to a shrine. Inside the shrine there are hundreds of keys, some bent, some broken and some serviceable.

We find the keys that match and get the cube.

We go pickup [[Vorn]]

## Sector 52

We find the shrine of [[Poppa'zotl]]. [[Cyan]] is unable to climb the stairs and falls into a pit of alligator. We fight a bunch of crocs and enter the shrine.

We find some writing that says "Papazotl teaches us to bow before no one"

we find some common writing saying

```
Comes with sunshine
Leaves with night
Hides in darkness
Does not bite
Always joined to its caster
Never strays from its master
```

We literally solve the hardest puzzle in the world. We get another cube.
