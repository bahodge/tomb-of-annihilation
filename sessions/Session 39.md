## Sector 28

 We search the area and find the [[Obelack]] shrine.  We do our secret snake handshake and head towards the shrine. We see a man and he is being attacked by 4 bears. The man looks familiar. He is the red wizard's guide. We intimidate the [[Zorbos]] and they scurry away. The guide's name is [[Orvex]]

We talk to the guide and he says they have 2 cubes but the red wizard who was carrying it was petrified. We learn that he was petrified as he picked up the cube.

They have [[Shagambi]]'s cube and [[Moze]]'s cube.

Inside of the shrine, there are walls and lit with torches. The corridors is painted with Omu'en reliefs depicting normal life. There is also some writing.

"[[Obelack]] teaches us to tread warily and stay in the light"
