We continue north in the tomb on level 1. We come across a hallway with an adamantine fan triggered by a pressure plate. We solve the puzzle and by opening keys within 3 chests. [[Indy]] smashes a sarcophagus with his adamantine sabre.

A mummy appears and we bigin combat. 

We kill the mummy and get a new fancy mace. We give the mace to [[Khar]] who is forced to drop his "special" ring. [[Khar]] tries to give the ring to someone else but we refuse and put it in the bag of holding.
