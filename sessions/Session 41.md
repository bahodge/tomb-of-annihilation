## Level 1
We continue north in the tomb on level 1. We come across a hallway with an adamantine fan triggered by a pressure plate. We solve the puzzle and by opening keys within 3 chests. [[Indy]] smashes a sarcophagus with his adamantine sabre.

A mummy appears and we bigin combat. 

We kill the mummy and get a new fancy mace. We give the mace to [[Khar]] who is forced to drop his "special" ring. [[Khar]] tries to give the ring to someone else but we refuse and put it in the bag of holding.

We continue to another room with a magnet statue that pulls quite hard. [[Khar]] finds a fountain. [[Khar]] drinks from the fountain and is transformed completely into a female. He is now a she named [[Khar|Khara]]

## Level 2

We go down the stairs and begin exploring the level. We find a giant green devil mask that seems to be a "death slide". 

We find a letter next to a dead body and a staff. We find another sarcophagus and upon opening it, the room locks and fills with wine. We fight some water elementals while [[Munch]] hides inside a sarcophagus.We kill a bunch of elementals and crawl through one of the gargoyle mouths that is spewing out the wine.

We find a salt pentagram and [[Khar|Khara]] immediately breaks it. We are attacked by an invisible creature.
