The [[Valley of Lost Honor]] is charred where the [[Dragon Tinder]] has devastated the land. As we are running through the valley, we see another [[chawinga]] with the mask of a brontosaurus. We approach the [[chawinga]] and it is playing. [[Munch]] and [[Indy]] fail to play with it. We leave and arrive at [[Shilku]]. [[Seethee Stonesmith]] is the dwarven leader in [[Shilku]]. 
We are introduced to [[Seethee Stonesmith]]. The last party that that came was [[Flaming Fists]] and they were all dead. We let her know that we are are here to help [[Hrakamar]] and kill the [[Dragon Tinder]]. She will assist us as she can. We tell her that we will go through [[Hrakamar]] first. [[Hrakamar]] is rich in [[adamantium]], a rare metal. Before the [[Dragon Tinder]] came, [[Wyrmheart Mine]] was called "Volcano". 

Advice:
- make sure we can kill the dragon
- make sure you can deal with fire
- we will find [[Dragon Tinder]] on the lowest level and her minions will be on higher levels.

[[Hrakamar]] is an underground town. There is a treasury past the lava river, that's the treasury $. She sends [[Musharib]] away. Inside the vault is a gauntlet. Whoever wields the [[Moradan's Gauntlet]] rules [[Hrakamar]]. [[Seethee Stonesmith]] says that [[Musharib]] is her competition. [[Munch]] is thinking of taking the gauntlet and throwing it in the lava. We go to speak with [[Musharib]].

We tell him that [[Seethee Stonesmith]] has interest in the throne. The [[Moradan's Gauntlet]]. He wants to make sure that they are smithing the right things. He wants to make weapons and things to end the undead blight.

We spend the night in [[Shilku]]. We prepare and head towards [[Hrakamar]]. We see the doors blown off and then we head inside. 

We march in with [[Vorn]] and [[Munch]] at the front, making lots of noise. We continue down the shaft and are ambushed by some [[fire newts]]. We kill all the [[fire newts]] and loot a vial of [[fire newt mucus]].

 - 3 [[fire newt mucus]] vials.

We use 2 [[fire newt mucus]] and lubricate the wheels of a mine cart to across the lava river. 

Next time:
	- continue fighting newts
