We start outside of [[Bosco's Bilge]]. We hear a voice wailing and approach a we see a full blooded orc tied up and being eaten by crabs. He is lanky and not as muscular as a regular orc. We head down towards the orc.

We ask why he is there and why we should free him. He was captured by the [[Sturge]] at [[Waterdeep]] and he couldn't find a lover for him so he was tied up. We ask him to help us capture the [[Emerald Eye]]. His name is [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]]. We untie him and tell him to stick with us. We see him put a skull in his backpack.

We hear a shout from the [[Emerald Eye]] and are told to bring up the bodies. We bring [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] with us to grab the bodies.

We grab the bodies and bring them to the [[Emerald Eye]] for payment. [[Pandora]] strong arms the [[Emerald Eye]] crew. We fight the crew and kill a bunch of them on the main deck.

We begin exploring the ship. We head to the quarters of [[Captain Zaroum Al-Saryak]]. We try to sell him the dead bodies we brought with us. We play hardball and the captain attack. We continue making our way down the decks fighting undead and [[shadow]] creatures.
