We start in combat with a bunch of enemies in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. We have already freed everyone's souls so now resurrection is now available again.

We end up killing the evil baby and [[Az'Sarak]] shows up angrilly. [[Ferrin]] uses his resurrection with the [[Eye of Zaltec]] to resurrect [[Munch]]!

The true winner of DND is Ben because he gets [[Munch]] back!

## Next Time
