We start our trek towards [[Mbala]] before heading to the [[Aldani Basin]]. We come to [[Mbala]] and are met with a massive plateau 1800 ft tall. There is a path leading up. [[Munch]] and [[Pandora]] climb up the cliff face in spider form while [[Indy]] and [[Jr]] walk up the path. The path is very untraveled. 

We arrive at [[Mbala]]. It is in ruins. We see a single hut remaining with smoke coming out of the chimney. We approach and knock on the hut. We see a very old and crippled. She is named [[Nanny Pu'Pu]] and she worships [[Myrkul]], the lord of bones. [[Eku]] is suspicious of her. We should investigate the [[pterafolk]] on the south side. [[Nanny Pu'Pu]] says that if we deal with all the [[pterafolk]], she will grant us a favor (revive a killed person).

We get to the cave and kill all of the [[pterafolk]]. We find 60 GP, a silvered dagger of greater healing. We then hide in the cave and set a trap for the rest of the flock. We completely massacred 12 [[pterafolk]].

[[Munch]], harvests 12 marrow bones from the dead.

Next Time:
- leave towards the floating boulder
