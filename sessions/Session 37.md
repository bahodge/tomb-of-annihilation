We stop resting at 09:45 am in Sector 37

## Sector 38

We see a building with a collapsed cellar. [[Munch]] and [[Cyan]] craw into the cellar. We see a little shrine with a book and a snake statue. [[Cyan]] sees the title of the book called [[Bloodlines of the Golden Throne]]. This snake looks very realistic but not petrified. There is an engraving begging the trickster gods to save her child.

## Sector 39

We continue to the water and see a large ship near a massive waterfall. We hear a lot of magical powers and the longship spills down the waterfall. It is occupied by 2 large giants and a large dog.

We reach the edge of the water and come across a large wall.

## Sector 46

We spot so [[Yuan-ti]] and they throw a spear at us and we run away. We head south.

## Sector 32

We see a crack in the wall surrounding the nicer part of the city. We slip through the crack. And sneak further into the city.

## Sector 33

We find a tunnel that leads into the back side of the shrine. We sneak down into the tunnel. The passage winds down into the bowels of the earth. We see harmless bugs. We continue down the tunnel. We find an underground river. Stalagtites hang low under it's surface. We see a massive door. [[Khar]] knocks on the door. We hear a slithering voice. The door swings open and we see a [[Yuan-ti]]. We are called slaves. [[Merrick Ravenshade]] opens the door. There are many alchemy reagents all over the room.

We capture the guy. We learn that we are in the [[Fane of the Night Serpent]]. He struggles and we kill him. We loot him and find

- We find a bronze syringe
- We find a brass key
- We get 20 unidentified potions
- We get 5 unidentified potions
- We get 5 unidentified potions

We continue down. We open a door and the poop door. We sneak in and we think that it is a [[Yuan-ti]] breeding room. We continue forward.

We see a bunch of [[Yuan-ti]] bathing in pools of blood. We burst into the room and attack them. We literally kill thousands. [[Munch]] suffers from [[organ damage]].

Next Time:
- we continue fighting and try to escape
