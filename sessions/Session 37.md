We stop resting at 09:45 am in Sector 37

## Sector 38

We see a building with a collapsed cellar. [[Munch]] and [[Cyan]] craw into the cellar. We see a little shrine with a book and a snake statue. [[Cyan]] sees the title of the book called [[Bloodlines of the Golden Throne]]. This snake looks very realistic but not petrified. There is an engraving begging the trickster gods to save her child.
