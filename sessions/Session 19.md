We approach [[Port Nyanzahru]] and begin separating out all of our treasure to pay for taxes.

[[Pandora]] asks if the [[utah raptor]] wants to stay with the party. We pay our taxes and head into the city. [[Munch]] rides [[Jr]]'s camel [[Ohana]]. [[Jr]] get a large ruby appraised by a jeweler in the city. We learn that misleading vendors is incredibly frowned upon. We sell all of our excess stuff.

[[Pandora]] inquires about [[Ifan Talroa]] to get [[Mormon]] trained in dinosaur racing. We learn that it will take 1 week to train [[Mormon]]. [[Indy]] goes to the arms dealer and looks for new weapons and buys a chain scimitar.

As we arrive into the town, the crew of the [[Star Goddess]] splits off from our group. We decide that we can meet back up with [[Akani Effa]] in [[Camp Vengeance]] when we get the ship back up and running. We learn about a [[zigurat]] west of [[Mbala]]. 

We walk into the magical item shop and see [[Trade Prince Wakanga Otamu]]. We ask about weapons available.

We walk to the [[Thundering Lizard]] and speak with [[Hugh Hackenstone]] and agree to help him get to [[Wyrmheart Mine]] and kill the red dragon there. We speak with the innkeeper and get rooms.

We learn that [[Artis Cymber]] was spotted in the east of [[Chult]] some time ago.

---

We spend the night and prepare to fight in the [[Fighting Arena]] in [[Port Nyanzahru]]. [[Cyan]] makes [[Munch]] and [[Jr]] new magical weapons. We arrive at the [[Fighting Arena]] and we scope out our challenges. We decide to fight beasts and almost die in the first round but manage to survive 7 rounds and are paid 325gp

Next Time:
- train [[Mormon]]
- Dino racing in [[Port Nyanzahru]]
- Commission a ship to take us to [[Wyrmheart Mine]]
