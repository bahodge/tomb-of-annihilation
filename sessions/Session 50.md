## Level 5

We head to the lair of the [[Hag Swin Sisters]].  [[Althea]] walks up to the door and starts into the room. We hear some cackling and some figures materialize. A hag appears and tries to spill acid on the party. We recognize one of the has as [[Nanny Pu'Pu]].

They say that they must protect "his" child. She also let us know that they have been spying on us.
