## Level 5

We head to the lair of the [[Hag Swin Sisters]].  [[Althea]] walks up to the door and starts into the room. We hear some cackling and some figures materialize. A hag appears and tries to spill acid on the party. We recognize one of the has as [[Nanny Pu'Pu]].

They say that they must protect "his" child. She also let us know that they have been spying on us. 

We break into a fight with the hags and kill a red haired one. The other two vanish! 

We loot the dead hag and kill some other things:
- 5 black marbles
- 1 illustrious stone - Hag's Hearthstone
- delicious kid's teeth
- 1 peg leg
- A second pouch 
	- opened and hearing a faint wailing
		- we throw this bag into the acid


We give the marbles and pegleg and tell the [[Indy]] clone to look for [[Artis Cymber]]. We insert the keys and the big green door opens.

We walk in and observe some tentacles and a baby that is tied to the cauldron by an umbilical cord. It is floating near a crystal. We fight the giant baby and and attack the disgusting enemies.
