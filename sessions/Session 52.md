We loot the room. [[Althea]] picks up the crown from [[Ferrin]]'s body. [[Munch]] has the [[Ubalaka]] ring.

We loot:
- 1 book "Manual of Golums"
- 1 book (some sort of spell book)
	- written in the book we see kimora (activate/deactivate) and blackfire (detonate)
	- It also talks about mirror codes
- We also loot 2 potions of greater healing from [[Ferrin]]'s body
- 9 litch phylactery bottles

We make a deal with the [[Hag Swin Sisters]] to resurrect [[Pandora]] & [[Jr]]. [[Is-It]] attempts to join the Hag's Coven. We brutally murder clone [[Indy]]. They resurrect Hag sister 3 from [[Ferrin]]'s body and [[Pandora]] with clone [[Indy]]'s body (yes we murdered him). [[Munch]] is polymorphed by [[Pandora]] into a beetle.

We continue through the blue portal.

We find [[Captain Taban]] sewn into a leather bag surrounded by creatures chained up. Turns out they are [[nothic]]s! We let one out and it tells us it wants magic items. Not fully what it wants, we kill it. Turns out it was a misunderstanding and we just murdered a few of them.

We continue through a curtain and find an ebon pool. We throw a marble into it an an obelisk appears. We are teleported to the entrance of the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. We see the [[Star Goddess]] flying overhead. [[Pandora]] and [[Captain Taban]] get loaded on to the ship.

Priorities:
1. Long Rest
2. Kill [[Ras Nisi]]
	1. Get [[Queen Grabstab]]
	2. Plant Seed
3. FInd [[Artis Cymber]]
4. Go to [[Port Nyanzahru]]

We take a long rest!

We see where there are remnants of a large battle. There are a bunch of dead [[Yuan-ti]]. The [[Grung]] were already murdered. We investigate and see some tracks leaving the battle. It is likely that there were some frost giants and that there were some humanoid tracks found. We find a satchel that belongs to [[Artis Cymber]] and it confirms our suspicions that he was taken by frost giants.

We send the [[Star Goddess]] to follow the tracks of the frost giants to the north and we head south to the front gate

We decide to go and find [[Ras Nisi]] and free [[Queen Grabstab]] and the other prisoners. We brutally kill [[Ras Nisi]] and his guard.

We loot the room and find:
- 1 flame tonge longsword
- 1 sending stone

We open a treasure room and a find
- 1 wine glass worth 50gp
- fancy clothes worth 75gp
- cloak worth 100gp
- Gilded moonshade harp worth 250gp
- 3 large cusions worth 25gp each
- leather bound spellbook
- 30 gemstones in an urn worth 50gp each
- 150pp in an unlocked wooded chest
- 350gp scattered on the floor
- 900sp scattered on the floor
- 3 Amethyst worth 100gp each

We kill all the remaining [[Yuan-ti]] between us and the prisoners and free the prisoners.

- [[Dragonbait]]
- [[Queen Grabstab]]
- [[Olooma Authdamar]]
- [[Pottery Shard]]
- [[sev]]
- [[Gorvax]]
- [[Zilla Atazi]]
- [[Lomar Dral]]

We ask [[Queen Grabstab]] where you can plant the seed and she tells of a place in the south. We get the seed from [[Azi Mas]] the snake and head to the location described by [[Queen Grabstab]].

We learn from [[Dragonbait]] that the frost giants found the [[Ring of Winter]] and are the cause of the cold climate.

We go to the pillar and plant the seed. It opens a giant portal and out comes a fey wild champion. [[Munch]] is granted thanks and congratulations from the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]] for saving her prince from the grey. [[Munch]] is given a seed which is [[Dormant infiltrator's key]].

We fly back to [[Port Nyanzahru]] and arrive a day later. As we go further north, it gets colder and colder. We go to talk to [[Grandfather Zatembe]] with his daughter [[Annette]]. We also meet with [[Syndra Silvayn]] and she is happy about us freeing the death curse. We let her know that it was [[Az'Sarak]]. [[Syndra Silvayn]] also says that we found the [[Skull Chalice of Ch'ghkare]].

All goblins welcome in [[Port Nyanzahru]] going forward! Huzzah!
