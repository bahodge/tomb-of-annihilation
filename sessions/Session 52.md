We loot the room. [[Althea]] picks up the crown from [[Ferrin]]'s body. [[Munch]] has the [[Ubalaka]] ring.

We loot:
- 1 book "Manual of Golums"
- 1 book (some sort of spell book)
	- written in the book we see kimora (activate/deactivate) and blackfire (detonate)
	- It also talks about mirror codes
- We also loot 2 potions of greater healing from [[Ferrin]]'s body
- 9 litch phylactery bottles

We make a deal with the [[Hag Swin Sisters]] to resurrect [[Pandora]] & [[Jr]]. [[Is-It]] attempts to join the Hag's Coven. We brutally murder clone [[Indy]]. They resurrect Hag sister 3 from [[Ferrin]]'s body and [[Pandora]] with clone [[Indy]]'s body (yes we murdered him). [[Munch]] is polymorphed by [[Pandora]] into a beetle.

We continue through the blue portal.

We find [[Captain Taban]] sewn into a leather bag surrounded by creatures chained up. Turns out they are [[nothic]]s! We let one out and it tells us it wants magic items. Not fully what it wants, we kill it. Turns out it was a misunderstanding and we just murdered a few of them.

We continue through a curtain and find an ebon pool. We throw a marble into it an an obelisk appears. We are teleported to the entrance of the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. We see the [[Star Goddess]] flying overhead. [[Pandora]] and [[Captain Taban]] get loaded on to the ship.

Priorities:
1. Long Rest
2. Kill [[Raj'nisi]]
	1. Get [[Queen Grabstab]]
	2. Plant Seed
3. FInd [[Artis Cymber]]
4. Go to [[Port Nyanzahru]]

We take a long rest!

We see where there are remnants of a large battle. There are a bunch of dead [[Yuan-ti]]. The [[Grung]] were already murdered. We investigate and see some tracks leaving the battle. It is likely that there were some frost giants and that there were some humanoid tracks found. We find a satchel that belongs to [[Artis Cymber]] and it confirms our suspicions that he was taken by frost giants.

We send the [[Star Goddess]] to follow the tracks of the frost giants to the north and we head south to the front gate

We decide to go and find [[Raj'nisi]] and free [[Queen Grabstab]] and the other prisoners.
