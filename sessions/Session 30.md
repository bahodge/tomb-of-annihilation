We start our session still in combat. We fight a whole massive group of [[fire newts]]. We kill all of them but 2 of them come out with 2 dwarven prisoners at knife point. We kill those [[fire newts]] and accidently kill the 2 dwarves with moonbeam. We revivify one of the dwarves but his mind is broken after a year of torture.

We begin looting around the area. We see that the [[fire elemental]] had died and left a massive stone that burns really hot. [[Indy]] picked it up with his fire resistant armor. We continue walking through the forge. We examine the statue. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] knocks over the statue.

[[Munch]] finds a box with a vague key shape. She discovers that it is a mold for a key. [[Cyan]] smiths a key using the mold. [[Cyan]] forges a second key. [[Pandora]] extends the bridge to get to the vault. [[Pandora]], [[Cyan]], [[Indy]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] go to unlock the vault. The keys disintegrate. We forge 2 other keys of adamantine and another unknown metal. Using those keys we open the vault. We collect [[Moradan's Gauntlet]].

We hand off the dwarf [[Malkar]] to [[Nanny Pu'Pu]] to watch as we continue down the cave towards [[Wyrmheart Mine]]. [[Munch]] hits on [[Cyan]]. [[Pandora]] hits on [[Indy]] and gets advice from [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]].

We harvest the [[fire newts]] bodies. We harvest 3 vials of [[fire newt mucus]]. We hack the statue apart and break it down into it's components. We find another adamantine key. We break it down into 20gp of gold and 400sp. [[Vorn]] is powered down. We setup the minecarts and continue towards [[Wyrmheart Mine]].

Next Time: 
- continue down the mine
- kill the dragon
