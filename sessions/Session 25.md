We split our party between [[Sturge]] and [[Emerald Eye]] ships.

[[Cyan]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] take some bodies from the [[Emerald Eye]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] eats [[Captain Zaroum Al-Saryak]] brain to access his memories. He learns that [[Dragon Fang]] captain is a magic caster. We learn that they are a tide sage, similar to [[Tide Sage Umberly]].
