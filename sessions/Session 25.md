We split our party between [[Sturge]] and [[Emerald Eye]] ships.

[[Cyan]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] take some bodies from the [[Emerald Eye]] and [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] eats [[Captain Zaroum Al-Saryak]] brain to access his memories. He learns that [[Dragon Fang]] captain is a magic caster. We learn tat they are a tide sage, similar to [[Tide Sage Umberly]]. We learn that they are liked by their crew. They are likely headed north to intercept trade ships headed to [[Port Nyanzahru]]. He has heard rumor that she is [[wereboar]]. [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] reanimates [[Captain Zaroum Al-Saryak]].

We go to [[Bosco's Bilge]] and have a meeting with [[Bosco]] and [[Jumal]] to discuss strategy for the upcoming battle. We learn that the [[Dragon Fang]]'s crew is more magic focused with 2 tide sages.
