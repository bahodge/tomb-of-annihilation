## Level 5

We open the last dresser and some wisps appear. [[Khara]] attacks one and they all turn invisible. They begin attacking us with magical attacks. We kill the wisps and the final gem lights up

[[Munch]] - Roast Boar: The character feels stronger and has advantage on Strength checks
[[Indy]] - Squash Stew: The character feels healthier and gains advantage on Constitution saving throws
[[Merrick]] - Iced Cakes: The character feels energized and gains 2d10 temporary hit points

We explore a bunch of other rooms and [[Khara]] starts another fight with some pages.
