We are planning to head to [[Camp Righteous]] with [[Miss Silvertusk]]. [[Indy]] tells us that [[Camp Righteous]] is a 6 day journey from [[Port Nyanzahru]]. No one really knows where the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] fell back to from [[Camp Vengeance]].

Shopping list:
Bug Spray - 1gp/20 applications
Food/Water
Traps
Canoe - 50GP and carry 6 people

TODO:
Create a porter character to act as a replacement if your character dies.

We buy a whole bunch of gear. We spoke with the guide [[Musharib]], fire newts forced all of the people out of [[Hrakamar]]. We speak with [[Eku]], and hire her to take us to [[Camp Righteous]]. [[Eku]] tells us more about the Yuan’ti and how they are powerful. [[Eku]] wants to stop by [[Mbala]], which is a sacred land on the way to [[Camp Righteous]]. In [[Mbala]], there is an old woman named [[Nanny Pu'Pu]]. We should squeeze her for information. In the [[Aldani Basin]]. We bring [[Annette]], with us on this expedition

Roster:
Annette | looking for [[Red Wizards of Thay]] -> [[Aldani Basin]]
[[Eku]] (guide) | learn what happened -> [[Mbala]]
[[Captain Taban]] (Porter)
[[Miss Silvertusk]] | deliver communiques to [[Commander Niles Breakbone]] -> [[Camp Righteous]]

We went to the [[Temple of Savrus]] to speak with [[Annette]]’s grandfather. We overhear a conversation with [[Grandfather Zatembe]]. Someone is trying to find [[Artis Cymber]]. We enter the room and fight some “zent” people. We kill 2 and 1 gets away. “Zents” are [[Zhentarum]]. [[Grandfather Zatembe]], is grateful for the rescue and explains the situation.

We loot the assassins, we find a pouch with a rather large ruby. 

[[Grandfather Zatembe]] can help [[Indy]] find [[Artis Cymber]]. [[Grandfather Zatembe]] tells us that there are a lot of strange vibes coming from the jungle. If we find out anything about the cause of the undead. He suspects that the Yuan’ti are involved.

[[Grandfather Zatembe]]’s visions:
His current visions include a black obelisk engulfed in vines.
A jungle city in the south enclosed by cliffs and crawling with snakes

We pay the gold and get Jr healed, after a long argument.

We wait 10 days for [[Pandora]] to heal.

Emery does an internship at the [[Temple of Sune]] while [[Pandora]] heals and learns about the gods of Chult and learns that all of the gods worshiped today are new. There used to be a god that everyone worshiped called [[Ubtoa]]. The great got [[Ubtoa]] once guided the people of chult, but got tired of the human’s nagging. The great god [[Ubtoa]] loved mazes. If we succeed the maze, we will gain his favor. There are many other foreign gods but none are really followed.

Jr spends his downtime learning about his reading from [[Grandfather Zatembe]]. He senses another dragon relative here in chult. A green dragon standing amongst the remains of another dragon.
