After leaving [[Fort Beluarian]] after killing [[Captain Porter]]. [[Trade Prince Jobal]] made us allies and rewarded us with money. We picked up a side mission to make [[Captain Taban|Taban]] to pay his debt. We fought him in the colosseum and won. [[Trade Prince Jobal]] gave us 3 diamonds for resurrection. After the uprising at the [[Fort Beluarian]], [[Jr]] stole some gold and a sending stone from [[Captain Porter]]â€™s office.

While bathing, we heard a rumor of a green dragon that roams [[Chult]].
