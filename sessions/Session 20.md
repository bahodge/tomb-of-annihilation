[[Munch]] robs a struggling merchant as a downtime activity and gains 25gp. [[Jr]] and [[Indy]] fight in the pits and win 75gp. [[Pandora]] helps train [[Mormon]] for dinosaur racing. As we stayed at the [[Thundering Lizard]], we watched some dino races. We ask a patron if they had ever seen a druid wildshape and race in the dino races. He doesn't know. We ask for the dino racing rules and are pointed to [[Ifan Talroa]]. 

We leave the [[Thundering Lizard]] and head to speak with [[Ifan Talroa]] about the rules. As we approach, we are grabbed by a strange woman and says "speak to the wise guardian of [[Oralunga]] west of [[Mbala]], she can direct us to that of which we seek". She faints. [[Pandora]] casts a healing word spell and heals the strange lady. She does not remember speaking with us. She is called [[Eshek]]. 

We arrive at the board and see the [[dino race]] rules. [[Indy]]'s friendship is based on money. We decide that [[Jr]] will ride [[Pandora]] during the [[unchained dino race]].

We bet on the race:
- [[Indy]] bets on the race 70gp to win
- [[Jr]] bets 42gp to win
- [[Munch]] bets 21gp to win
- [[Pandora]] bets 70gp to win

Based off our speed, the bookies have ranked us 7:1.

[[Munch]] and [[Indy]] walk the track and look for things to sabotage. 

[[Pandora]] and [[Jr]] line up on the starting line against [[Big Honker]], [[Banana Candy]] and other dinos. [[Indy]] pushes some oils into the race track and [[Munch]] pushes a child. The child is impaled on the horns of a triceratops racer named [[Banana Candy]]. 

[[Pandora]] and [[Jr]] win the race and are awarded 300gp. [[Munch]] is arrested for pushing the child into the race and died. The party grabs [[Nanny Pu'Pu]] to revive the child. She says that we need to gather a life for a life. The party approaches the prison. The party tries to convince the guards of the prison that they can revive the child in exchange for [[Munch]]'s life. The guards don't like goblins.  The most dangerous criminal in the prison is [[Omala]] and the party wants to use him to exchange for the life of the girl. The party must submit themselves by the end of the night to the prison.

We will have to speak with [[Trade Prince Jesamine]] to handle the sentencing of [[Munch]].

[[Munch]] is able to remember the path to her cell from the entrance. [[Munch]]'s cellmate is [[Omala]] who bought some dancing monkey fruit and made dye out of band of the trade prince.

The party thinks that they can make a deal with a trade prince. They remember that they cleared a mine for [[Trade Prince Zhan'ti]]. They go to her palace and convince a guard to meet with the trade prince. The party is granted an audience. The party makes deal with the trade prince to kill all of the pirates. [[Munch]] is released from prison and rejoins the group. We are never to talk about killing a child again.

- We get a pardon for 1 head
- We get favor with all the trade princes with 3 heads

We also learn that the ship we rescued at the very beginning survived the shipwreck. We head to the harbor and see the [[Harbor Master Zendar]].  We inform him of our plan. 

We are given the ship and crew [[Jack Canary]], [[Captain Taban]] and [[Xandraugh]]. We decide to name the ship [[Dinoseur Ship]]

We are warned of the pirates patrolling the west coast. The big three are [[Elock J'harwan]], [[Laskilar]] and [[Zaroum Al-Saryak]]

- 2000gp for each ship captured.
- 500gp for each captain head (preferably alive).

We learn that the red dragon at [[Wyrmheart Mine]] will not immediately kill because it is interested in learning about the world. She also does not hold back when using her breath. She likes to hear her victims scream. She also is confident in her lair.

We assign [[Captain Taban]] and name him [[Captain Taban]] of the [[Dinoseur Ship]].

 We leave the port and see [[Syndra Silvayn]] and tell her what we have learned about the undead. She look more pale and is feeling more weak. We info dump. She reminds us that we should search for [[Artis Cymber]]. She gives a circlet of telepathy to [[Pandora]].

we head back to the [[Thundering Lizard]]

Next time:
- sail off to hunt pirates
