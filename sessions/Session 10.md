Day 3

We are near [[Camp Righteous]]. [[Eku]] explains that the camp is a ramshackle camp outside of an old ruin, the man and the alligator shrine. [[Eku]] explains the fable of the shrine where we learn that man and alligators are no longer friends. [[Jr]] explains why camp righteous exists, but lost contact with them months ago. Last he heard [[Miss Silvertusk]] had abandoned his post.

[[Cyan]] creates 3 healing potions the traditional way.

Day 4

We arrive at the camp, it is in tatters. We dock out canoes on the small dock on the south side of the camp. The camp looks destroyed. We search some of the larger officer tents and find nothing interesting. We come across a small bird called an [[Axebeak]]. [[Pandora]] feeds it and both she and [[Jr]] reach out try to tame it but it falls asleep. [[Pandora]] finds a necklace and gives it to [[Emery]]. [[Cyan]] falls into an outhouse hole and finds a body with a pouch with some gems.

We explore the cave and do an Indiana Jones move and plunder a jug that looks like an alchemy jug? We exit the cave and come across many goblins dawning wooden masks (stacked like totem poles). The goblins gesture they want the jug we grabbed. We speak with [[Eku]] but she wasn’t able to convince them that we were ok so we fought the goblins. We killed everyone of the goblins.

We loot them and get:
-  Charred stick
-  Coin purse
