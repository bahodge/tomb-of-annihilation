## Level 3

We approach a circular room with a floating spherical figure floating 20 in the air. [[Munch]] rushes in and attacks the sphere but the arrow is inneffective. The sphere emits a voice in deep speech that we shall not survive the terrible eye rays of [[Balkazor]]. We start combat against this sphere. [[Munch]] discovers that you can hurt it from under like a turtle.

## Level 4

We continue down the stairs and see 4 large gargoyle statues and another warning. [[Indy]] reads the warning we see. We begin exploring and the gargoyle statues come to life. [[Vorn]] bravely protects [[Munch]] and the rest of the party. [[Vorn]] is killed. [[Munch]] is incapacitated and thrown down an abyssal hole as the rest of the [[Dinoseurs]] fight for their lives against the remaining gargoyles.
