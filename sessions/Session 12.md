Before we go to sleep, we speak with goblins around the camp. We leave the camp to the north with dinosaurs. We learn more about the goblins and learn that [[Munch]] will take us into the forest to find dinosaurs.

[[Munch]] tells us that there is a pack of large raptors up to the north west. We are warned that they are very smart.

We prepare traps for the [[Utah raptor]]s. And come up with a plan for killing the raptors. We fight and kill 6 larger raptors and 2 small raptors. We take the raptors back to camp.

We head back to camp and launch the goblins. [[Emery]] is launched and goes MIA. The party mourns and [[Munch]] joins the party.
