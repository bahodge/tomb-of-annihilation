We begin to see the land for the first time and see [[Chult]]. The other ships are following us. A gigantic dragon turtle appears in front of our ship. The turtle is named [[Arameg]], we bargain with it and Junior promises 10% of all treasure we find. [[Arameg]] goes to the next ship. [[Arameg]] destroys the captured pirate ship. We speak with the merchants and they say as payment for rescuing them they would put in a good word with [[Trade Prince Zhan'ti]], a trade prince. We continue towards the peninsula. 

As we are sailing towards the land, we discover a stowaway, [[Silinor]] who joins our party. 

We will dock at the royal harbor of [[Port Nyanzahru]]. We question the pirate captain and get nothing out of her. We learn the going rate. We let the pirate captain go, and the harbormaster immediately executes her and pays 20 gold. The harbormaster’s name was [[Harbor Master Zendar]]. We learn that there are 3 pirate ships terrorizing the merchants and we should try to kill them.

We speak with [[Syndra Silvayn]] and learn a little more about [[Port Nyanzahru]]. [[Cyan]] asks about the statue in the port, but learns that it is just a tourist attraction.

We walked to the [[Temple of Sune]] to purchase clothes. We purchase new clothes and are given temporary robes as we go bathe. We learn from speaking with a triceratops named [[Chowatha]] and recommend that we bet on [[Big Honker]] in the [[dino race]]s

We witness the [[dino race]] where we see a dinosaur get injured. We heal the triceratops named [[Banana Candy]], whose patron is [[Trade Prince Ifan Talro’a]] We come up with a group name and settle on [[Dinoseurs]]. We then arrive at the public bathhouses. We speak with a few of the patrons and learn about a board by the inn where the guides advertise themselves.

We pick up our newly purchased clothes and make our way to the home of [[Trade Prince Zhan'ti]]. We speak with the guards and they tell us to see them out at the Golden throne during their day of audience. We leave and head to the [[Thundering Lizard]].

A guard rips a flyer off of the board and pick up the flyer. We look over all the fliers and find [[Musharib]] and choose him as our guide. We speak with the innkeeper and get rooms. [[Pandora]] makes a deal with the innkeeper to do a performance in exchange for a room. We speak with [[Musharib]] the guide and confirm that he can help us get to [[Hrakamar]]. He will charge us 50gp

 We decide that we want to fight in the [[colesseum]] and meet [[Akina Afa]] and register for a fight the next day at 10AM.
