## Level 4

[[Khara]] decends down into the abyss

## Level 5

Our bodies are within a massive chamber of rot. [[Khara]] feeds good berries to the rest of the party. The gargoyles peer down the chamber from above and don't see anyone. Everyone in the party is brought up with a wound.

[[Munch]] now has a horrible scar that cannot be easily conceled. She has disadvantage on persuasion check and advantage on intimidation checks.

[[Merrick]] has a minor scar.

[[Indy]] now has a horrible scar that cannot be easily conceled. He has disadvantage on persuasion check and advantage on intimidation checks. 

On this day [[Khara]] saved the entire party.

We continue down the corridor and come across a hallway with some mysterious goop. We then try to pick a lock and fail and a giant stone juggernaut comes out of the wall and we run away.
