## Level 4

[[Khara]] decends down into the abyss

## Level 5

Our bodies are within a massive chamber of rot. [[Khara]] feeds good berries to the rest of the party. The gargoyles peer down the chamber from above and don't see anyone. Everyone in the party is brought up with a wound.

[[Munch]] now has a horrible scar that cannot be easily conceled. She has disadvantage on persuasion check and advantage on intimidation checks.

[[Merrick]] has a minor scar.

[[Indy]] now has a horrible scar that cannot be easily conceled. He has disadvantage on persuasion check and advantage on intimidation checks. 

On this day [[Khara]] saved the entire party.

We continue down the corridor and come across a hallway with some mysterious goop. We then try to pick a lock and fail and a giant stone juggernaut comes out of the wall and we run away.

[[Munch]] dashes around the corner and takes the ruby. The ruby looks incredibly expensive. The Juggernaut barrels back towards [[Munch]]. The party narrowly escapes and destroys the juggernaut.

We find a statue of a gargoyle. One of it's arms is broken. We find a secret corridor and [[Khara]] talks to a talking door that eats crabs. We continue through the level.

We come across a stone lectern.

A four-foot-high, seven-foot-wide iron lectern in the middle of this rusty, iron-plated room is topped by a slanted control panel. Set into the control panel are a gold lever with a star-shaped handle, two dials in red and blue, and two buttons of the same colors. Wall engravings behind the control panel show five groups of circles, with a small crystal embedded in the wall under each one. The crystal under the configuration labeled “3” glows bright green. Three six-inch-diameter rusty iron pipes jut from the wall above the engravings.

We go into the main room with the jewel door gems and start opening crates. [[Munch]] and [[Khara]] start calling for help and [[Indy]] and [[Merrick]] run into the room and kill everything. We continue opening dressers.
