[[Pandora]] asks [[Hugh Hackenstone]] why he hates the dragon at [[Wyrmheart Mine]]. The dragon bit off his arm and taken over the mine. It also interrupted his business. We are presented the options to sail down the river, go through the [[Aldani Basin]] or sail along the western shore or go around the eastern or we can go over the [[Kobold Mountains]]. We could also sail to [[Shilku]]. We remember that this is where [[Captain Porter]] sent her scouts and wants us to investigate.

We go back to [[Oculeth]] and propose that we will take his teleporter components and assemble a new one in [[Shilku]]. [[Oculeth]] accepts the proposal. We also get him to allow us to travel to [[Camp Vengeance]] and and grab [[Vorn]]. We go through the teleportation circle and grab [[Vorn]]. 

We see [[Commander Niles Breakbone]] and speak with him. We see [[Sister Cyas]] and ask her to restore [[Hugh Hackenstone]] new arm. We ask her if she has been able to heal anyone with [[The Grey]]. She said no. We ask about the monolith of [[Grandfather Zatembe]]'s vision. No one knows.

We cashed in the 1 free greater restoration from [[Sister Cyas]]. We also ask [[Hugh Hackenstone]] to help us skin the dragon. We learn that [[Hugh Hackenstone|Hugh]] is a berzerker and would help us kill the dragon. [[Indy]] and and [[Pandora]] recruit [[Zendalla]] while [[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] and [[Munch]] buy [[Indy]] and birthday gift. [[Pandora]] doesn't trust her.

We go to the [[Thundering Lizard]] and celebrate [[Indy]]'s birthday. [[Pandora]] makes sexual advances to all of the party members and fails hard. As we are talking at a table, and some people say "a debt to be filled" and assassinate [[Munch]]. They also say "for [[Calindra]]". [[Munch]] is now suffers from [[nausea]]. She also has 1 wound. [[Munch]] and the party somehow survive the attack. [[Pandora]] cures [[Munch]]'s [[nausea]].

We loot the bodies.

- 2 shortswords
- 2 hand crossbows
- 2 vials with some residue

[[Lorenzo von Matterhorn]] takes the bodies and eats their brain. He asks who sent them, "the black hand".  He learns that they have a secret meeting room in [[Trade Princess Jesamine]]'s villa.

We go to sleep and wake up and [[Pandora]] notices that her flute is missing. We leave the [[Thundering Lizard]] and look to speak with [[Trade Princess Jesamine]] to inquire about the assassins going after [[Munch]]. [[Indy]] inquires about a deal to make the [[Dinoseurs]] off-limits to all assassination attempts. We learn that the parents of [[Calindra]] are now dead after paying for the contract that failed on [[Munch]].  She tasks us to figure out what is causing [[The Grey]].  We learn that the [[Golden Banner]] is also headed south to investigate [[The Grey]].

We teleport to [[Camp Vengeance]] and we start moving towards [[Shilku]]. We continue to [[Shilku]] and pick some orange flowers. We see a [[chawinga]] and it runs away. [[Pandora]] sits in a field waiting for a [[chawinga]] to appear. One appears and gives her a flower. She is now a happy kiddo.

We continue south into the unknown. As we continue down towards [[Hrakamar]], we see some vibrant red parrot. [[Indy]] tries to sneak up to the birds but gets shit on. [[Pandora]] whistles and another [[chawinga]]. She consistently one up's [[Indy]]. We come across a snake orgy in a pit. We start fucking with [[Indy]] and [[Pandora]] tries to scare him and he falls out of the tree super gracefully. We see a [[chawinga]] with a snake mask. After the snake orgy, it crawls into the [[chawinga]]'s mouth and the [[chawinga]] slithers away. No one has any idea of what the fuck is going on.

We arrive at the [[Valley of Lost Honor]]

Next Time:
- Arrive at [[Hrakamar]]
- kill all the fire newts
