 When you complete a long rest, you must succeed at a Constitution saving throw DC
15 or gain the poisoned condition until you complete a long rest. Magic such as the
regenerate spell can cure your kidney failure. Alternatively, someone can tend to the
kidney failure and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every week. After ten
successes, the kidney failure is resolved.
