Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and canâ€™t use reactions until the
start of your next turn. Magic such as the regenerate spell can cure your organ damage.
Alternatively, someone can tend to the organ damage and make a DC 15 Wisdom
(Medicine) check once every day. After ten successes, the organ damage is resolved.
